Over the past four decades, immense progress has been made on methods for solving fluid-solid interaction problems \citep{belytschko1980quasi, donea1982arbitrary, van2021vanguard}. Modelling approaches for fluid-solid interaction can be classified by:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Modelling viewpoint}: Eulerian vs Lagrangian vs mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian;
	\item \textbf{Degree of coupling}: weakly vs strongly coupled;
	\item \textbf{Solver structure}: partitioned vs monolithic.
\end{itemize}

Eulerian approaches treat both solid and fluid domains as ``fluid-like" (e.g. volume-of-fluid \citep{jain2019conservative}, level-set \citep{dunne2006eulerian, cottet2008eulerian}), easily allowing for arbitrarily large solid deformations. However, conservative, accurate interface descriptions and the inclusion of advanced solid constitutive laws are challenges. This would make the inclusion of heart valves particularly troublesome, for example. In contrast, Lagrangian (particle-type) approaches treat both domains as ``solid-like", e.g. smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH), material point method (MPM) and the particle finite element method (PFEM) \citep{aubry2005particle, aubry2006fractional, cremonesi2020state}. Although promising for large deformation problems, Lagrangian methods typically come with a prohibitively expensive computational cost; this restriction would be fatal for cardiac xenotransplant simulations, which are already expected to be slow. Finally, mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian approaches treat the solid and interface as Lagrangian and the fluid as arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE). This approach is effective for small interface deformations but will eventually fail for large deformations \citep{wall2006large}. Consequently, significant attention has been focused on methods that allow the solid to "float over" the Eulerian fluid grid, e.g. immersed boundaries/domains \citep{peskin1977numerical, peskin2002immersed, iaccarino2003immersed}, Chimera/overset methods \citep{ge2003three, miller2014overset, li2021fluid, cane2021patient} and cut-cell methods \citep{pasquariello2016cut, tao2020new, xie2020cartesian}. Of these approaches, overset methods provide the same large deformation freedom but with the added advantage of maintaining orthogonal interface cells to capture fluid boundary layers.

In cases where strict enforcement of kinematic and dynamic interface continuity conditions is not required, reasonable results can be attained when both the fluid and solid domains are solved once per time step \citep{farhat2000two}. However, this approach is unstable for strongly coupled systems, as is expected in cardiac xenotransplant simulations. In contrast, strongly coupled approaches strictly enforce the interface conditions at each time step. This strong coupling can be achieved in different ways, depending on the solver structure: partitioned vs monolithic.

In partitioned (staggered/two-system) approaches, separate solvers (and potentially discretisations) are used for the fluid and solid \citep{tukovic2018openfoam}. Consequently, outer iterations must be performed over the fluid and solid domains at each time step, e.g. using Aitken’s acceleration \citep{degroote2009performance, bungartz2016precice, irons1969version, kuttler2008fixed}, quasi-Newton procedures \citep{santiago2020hpc, delaisse2022surrogate}, or Robin-type coupling \citep{tukovic2019added}. The main limitations of these approaches can be robustness and efficiency, whereas for highly nonlinear, tightly coupled systems, convergence may not be possible or may be prohibitively slow. This is of concern for a whole heart simulation with multiple deforming structures (valves, chambers, vessels) undergoing complex deformations. In contrast, monolithic approaches treat the entire solid-fluid domain as one system, where the discretised fluid and solid problems are solved concurrently in the same linearised system \citep{degroote2009performance}. The primary advantage of monolithic methods is their ability to deal with tightly coupled nonlinear systems, as well as potentially being faster than partitioned approaches (fewer outer iterations). The disadvantages are related to the loss of modularity and the resulting poorly conditioned linear system being more challenging to solve.

\section{Mathematical Models}\label{sec:math_model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The present work focuses on the time evolution of a system (Figure \ref{fig:fsi_problem}) that occupies moving domain $\Omega(t)$, which is composed of a moving solid domain $\Omega^s(t)$ and a moving fluid domain $\Omega^f(t)$.
The boundary of system domain $\bb{\Gamma}$ is composed of solid $\bb{\Gamma}^s$ and fluid $\bb{\Gamma}^f$ regions, and the region where the solid and fluid boundaries coincide is termed the \emph{fluid-solid interface}.
The problem consists of determining the time evolution of the system configuration from the initial configuration ($\Omega^s_0$, $\Omega^f_0$, $\bb{\Gamma}^s_0$, $\bb{\Gamma}^f_0$) to the deformed configuration ($\Omega^s(t)$, $\Omega^f(t)$, $\bb{\Gamma}^s(t)$, $\bb{\Gamma}^f(t)$) at time $t$.
%$\bb{\Gamma} = \bb{\Gamma}^f \cup \bb{\Gamma}^s$ but exclude FSI interface.
%dynamic interaction between a laminar, Newtonian, incompressible, isothermal fluid and a nonlinear hyperelastic, compressible solid.
%The mechanical problem under consideration is a time-varying domain $\Omega(t)$ is composed of a solid domain $\Omega(t)^s$ and a fluid domain $\Omega(t)^f$
%In this section, the governing equations for the fluid-solid interaction problem are presented in the \emph{deformed} configuration; that is, the integrals are given over the deformed solid and fluid domains.
%As the deformed configurations are unknown (the solid deformation is to be determined), the governing equations are subsequently presented over known \emph{reference} configurations, exploiting appropriate mappings from the deformed configuration.
%Consider a representative fluid-solid interaction problem (Figure \ref{fig:fsi_problem}

%\subsection{Governing Equations in the Deformed Configurations}
%%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%

%%----------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Solid Dynamics Governing Equations}
%%----------------------------------------------------------%%
Dynamics of the solid region are governed by linear momentum conservation, which can be expressed in Lagrangian form on the deformed configuration as
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:solid_momentum_deformed}
    \int_{\Omega^s} \frac{\partial \rho^s \bb{v} }{\partial t} d\Omega^s
    =
    \oint_{\Gamma^s} \hat{\bb{n}}^s \cdot \bb{\sigma} \ d\Gamma^s
    + \int_{\Omega^s}  \bb{f}_b^s \, d\Omega^s
\end{eqnarray}
where $\rho^s$ is the density, $\bb{v}^s$ is the velocity vector, $\hat{\bb{n}}^s$ is the unit outwards-facing normal to surface $\Gamma^s$, $\bb{\sigma}^s$ is the true (Cauchy) stress tensor, and $\bb{f}_b^s$ is a body force per unit volume, e.g. $\bb{f}_b^s = \rho^s \bb{g}$ for a gravity body force, where $\bb{g}$ is gravitionational acceleration.
For notational simplicity, the time dependence notation $(t)$ has been omitted from the moving volumes and surfaces; that is, $\Omega(t) \equiv \Omega$ and $\Gamma(t) \equiv \Gamma$.


%$\hat{\bb{n}}^s = \nicefrac{\bb{\Gamma}}{|\bb{\Gamma}|}$ is the outwards-pointing unit surface normal,

The integrals above (Equation \ref{eqn:solid_momentum_deformed}) are expressed over the as-yet-unknown deformed configuration. 
These integrals can be reexpressed over the known initial configuration by introducing the deformation gradient $\bb{F} = \textbf{I} + (\bb{\nabla} \bb{d})^{\text{T}}$ and its determinant as $J = \text{det}[\bb{F}]$, in terms of the displacement vector $\bb{d}$ and del operator $\bb{\nabla}$.
Note that the current work adopts the convention that $(\nabla d)_{ij} = \nicefrac{\partial d_j}{\partial x_i}$, so, to avoid confusion, $\bb{F}$ and $J$ are expressed in index notation as $F_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + \frac{\partial d_i}{\partial X_j}$ and $J = \frac{1}{6} \varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon_{pqr} F_{ip} F_{jq} F_{kr}$, where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta and $\varepsilon_{ijk}$ is the permutation symbol.

Employing $\bb{F}$ and $J$, volume integrals can be expressed over the initial configuration as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \int_{\Omega^s} \bb{T} \; \text{d}\Omega^s &=& \int_{\Omega_0^s} J \bb{T} \; \text{d}\Omega^s_0
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bb{T}$ represents an arbitrary scalar, vector or tensor field.
From this, $J$ can be interpreted as the ratio of the deformed to the initial volume $J = \nicefrac{\Omega^s}{\Omega_0^s}$, allowing the current density to be expressed in terms of the initial density as $\rho^s = J \rho_0^s$.
Similarly, surface integrals over the deformed configuration can be reexpressed over the initial configuration as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \oint_{\Gamma^s} \hat{\bb{n}}^s \cdot \bb{T} \; \text{d}\Gamma^s &=&
    \oint_{\Gamma_0^s} \left(J \bb{F}^{-T} \cdot \hat{\bb{n}}_0^s \right) \cdot \bb{T} \; \text{d}\Gamma_0^s
\end{eqnarray}
where the $\cdot$ operator is replaced by a suitable scalar/vector/tensor multiplication operator.
Here, $J \bb{F}^{-T}$ can be seen to rotate and scale the normal vector from the initial to the deformed configuration;
this stems from Nanson's relation, $\bb{\Gamma} = J \bb{F}^{-T} \cdot \bb{\Gamma}_0$, which relates the deformed area vector $\bb{\Gamma}$ to the initial area vector $\bb{\Gamma}_0$. 

With these mappings, linear momentum conservation can be expressed in the so-called \emph{total Lagrangian} form, where integrals are given over the initial configuration:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:solid_momentum_TL}
    \int_{\Omega_0^s} \rho_0 \frac{\partial^2 \bb{d} }{\partial t^2} \; d\Omega_0^s
    &=&
    \oint_{\Gamma_0^s} \left( J \bb{F}^{-\text{T}} \cdot \bb{n}_0^s \right) \cdot \bb{\sigma}^s \ d\Gamma_0^s
    + \int_{\Omega_0^s}  \bb{f}_{b_0}^s \, d\Omega_0^s
\end{eqnarray}
The body force $\bb{f}_{b_0}^s$ is per unit \emph{initial} volume, e.g. $\bb{f}_{b_0}^s = \rho^s_0 \bb{g}$.

%where $\Omega_o$ is the volume of an arbitrary body bounded by a surface $\Gamma_o$ with outwards pointing normal $\bb{n}_o$.
%Subscript $o$ indicates quantities in the initial reference configuration, which is assumed stress-free here.
%The density is $\rho$, $t$ is time, $\bb{d}$ is the displacement vector, $\bb{\sigma}$ is the true (Cauchy) stress tensor (\hl{stress is prescribed on boundary faces}), and $\bb{f}_b$ is a body force per unit volume, e.g., $\rho \bb{g}$, where $\bb{g}$ is gravity.

%The deformation gradient is defined as $\bb{F} = \textbf{I} + (\bb{\nabla} \bb{d})^{\text{T}}$ and its determinant as $J = \text{det}(\bb{F})$, or in index notation as $F_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + \frac{\partial d_i}{\partial X_j}$ and $J = \frac{1}{6} \varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon_{pqr} F_{ip} F_{jq} F_{kr}$.

The definition of the true stress ($\bb{\sigma}^s$ in Equations \ref{eqn:solid_momentum_deformed} and \ref{eqn:solid_momentum_TL}) is given by a chosen mechanical law.
Four mechanical laws are considered in this work, as defined in Appendix A of \citet{Cardiff2025JFNK}: linear elasticity (Hooke's law), and three forms of hyperelasticity (St.\ Venant-Kirchhoff, neo-Hookean, and Guccione).
%\hl{We may need to mention linear elasticity, depending on the test case - or not}

Three types of boundary conditions for the solid domain are considered here: prescribed displacement, prescribed traction, and symmetry.

%The displacement increment is the change in displacement between the current time step and the previous time step when the time interval is discretised into a finite number of steps.

\subsection{Fluid Dynamics Governing Equations} \label{sec:fluid_governing_eqn}
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%

The dynamics of the moving fluid region are governed by mass conservation and linear momentum conservation.
%, which can be expressed in Lagrangian form on the deformed configuration as
%
%An arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is adopted for the fluid formulation in the current, defined by mass continuity, linear momentum conservation, and space conservation.
Mass continuity is equivalent to volume continuity for an incompressible material and can be expressed for a moving domain as
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:continuity_deformed_full}
	\frac{d}{dt} \int_{\Omega^f} \, d\Omega^f
	\;+\; \oint_{ \Gamma^f} \hat{\bb{n}}^f \cdot (\bb{v}^f - \boldsymbol{v}^{\Gamma}) \, d\Gamma^f = 0
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bb{v}^f$ is the fluid velocity, and $\boldsymbol{v}^\Gamma$ is the velocity of the moving surface $\Gamma^f$.
%$\Omega$ is the volume of an arbitrary body bounded by a surface $\Gamma$ with outwards pointing normal $\bb{n}$,
The continuity equation simplifies to
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:continuity_deformed}
	\oint_{ \Gamma^f} \hat{\bb{n}}^f \cdot \bb{v}^f \, d\Gamma^f = 0
\end{eqnarray}
by using the geometric (space) conservation law
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:space_conservation}
	\frac{d}{dt} \int_{\Omega^f} \, d\Omega^f
	\; - \; \oint_{ \Gamma^f} \hat{\bb{n}}^f \cdot \boldsymbol{v}^\Gamma \, d\Gamma^\Gamma = 0
\end{eqnarray}
%which states that the rate of change of the fluid domain volume (or a subset of it) must equal the net flux of the velocity across its boundaries.


Similarly, linear momentum can be expressed in Eulerian form for a laminar, Newtonian, incompressible, isothermal fluid in a moving domain as
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:momentum_fluid_deformed}
	\frac{d}{dt} \int_{\Omega^f} \bb{v}^f \, d\Omega^f
	+ \oint_{\Gamma^f} \hat{\bb{n}}^f \cdot (\bb{v}^f - \bb{v}^\Gamma) \boldsymbol{v}^f \, d\Gamma^f
	=  \oint_{\Gamma^f} \hat{\bb{n}}^f \cdot \bb{\sigma}^f \, d\Gamma^f
%	=  \oint_{\Gamma^f} \hat{\bb{n}}^f \cdot \left(\nu \bb{\nabla} \bb{v}^f \right) \, d\Gamma^f
%%	+ \frac{1}{\rho} \int_{\Omega} \bb{\nabla} p \, d\Omega
%	+ \int_{\Omega^f} \bb{\nabla} p \, d\Omega^f
	+ \int_{\Omega^f} \bb{f}_b^f \, d\Omega^f
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bb{f}_b^f$ are body forces per mass, e.g., $\bb{f}_b^f = g$.
The true (Cauchy) stress $\bb{\sigma}^f$ is defined for a Newtonian fluid as
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:fluid_stress}
	\bb{\sigma}^f &=& \nu \bb{\nabla} \bb{v}^f + \nu \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{v}^f \right)^T - p \textbf{I}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $p$ is the kinematic pressure (pressure per density), and $\textbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:momentum_fluid_deformed}
%	\frac{d}{dt} \int_{\Omega^f} \bb{v}^f \, d\Omega^f
%	+ \oint_{\Gamma^f} \hat{\bb{n}}^f \cdot (\bb{v}^f - \bb{v}^\Gamma) \boldsymbol{v}^f \, d\Gamma^f
%	=  \oint_{\Gamma^f} \hat{\bb{n}}^f \cdot \left(\nu \bb{\nabla} \bb{v}^f \right) \, d\Gamma^f
%%	+ \frac{1}{\rho} \int_{\Omega} \bb{\nabla} p \, d\Omega
%	+ \int_{\Omega^f} \bb{\nabla} p \, d\Omega^f
%%	+ \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{f} \, d\Omega
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $p$ is the kinematic pressure (pressure per density), and other body forces, such as gravity, are neglected here.
%$\rho$ is the density, 

As was the case for the solid dynamics equations, the integrals above (Equations \ref{eqn:continuity_deformed} and \ref{eqn:momentum_fluid_deformed}) are expressed over the unknown deformed fluid configuration and must be expressed over a known configuration.
To achieve this, we employ the deformation gradient $\bb{F}^{\Gamma}$ for the moving fluid domain; that is, the deformation of the fluid domain is driven by the motion of the fluid-solid interface, where, as yet, we have not defined a governing equation for the propagation of this interface motion into the fluid domain.
For a given fluid domain displacement $\bb{d}^{\Gamma}$, the fluid domain deformation gradient is defined as $\bb{F}^{\Gamma} = \textbf{I} + (\bb{\nabla} \bb{d}^\Gamma)^{\text{T}}$ and its determinant as $J^\Gamma = \text{det}[\bb{F}^\Gamma]$.

Employing $\bb{F}_{\Gamma}$ and $J_\Gamma$, volume continuity can be expressed in terms of an integral over the initial fluid configuration as
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:continuity_initial}
%	\oint_{\Gamma^f_0}  \left( J \bb{F}^{-\text{T}} \cdot \hat{\bb{n}}_0^s \right)  \cdot (\bb{v}^f - \boldsymbol{v}^{\Gamma}) \, d\Gamma^f_0 = 0
	\oint_{\Gamma^f_0}  \left( J \bb{F}^{-\text{T}} \cdot \hat{\bb{n}}_0^f \right) \cdot \bb{v}^f \, d\Gamma^f_0 = 0
\end{eqnarray}

Before expressing linear momentum conservation over the initial configuration, we must introduce the mapping of the gradient operator in the deformed configuration to the gradient operator in the initial configuration:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\bb{\nabla} \bb{T} = \bb{F}^{-T} \cdot \left( \bb{\nabla}_0 \bb{T} \right) \\
	\left( \bb{\nabla} \bb{T} \right)^T = \left( \bb{\nabla}_0 \bb{T} \right)^T \cdot  \bb{F}^{-1} 
\end{eqnarray}

With these mappings, linear momentum conservation for the fluid can be expressed over the initial configuration as
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:momentum_fluid_deformed}
%	\int_{\Omega^f_0} J_\Gamma \frac{\partial \bb{v}^f}{\partial t} \, d\Omega^f_0
%	+ \oint_{\Gamma^f_0}  \left( J \bb{F}^{-\text{T}} \cdot \bb{n}_0^s \right) \cdot (\bb{v}^f - \bb{v}_\Gamma) \boldsymbol{v}^f \, d\Gamma^f_0
%	= \notag \\
%	 \oint_{\Gamma^f_0}  \left( J \bb{F}^{-\text{T}} \cdot \bb{n}_0^s \right) \cdot \left[\nu \bb{F}^{-T} \cdot \left( \bb{\nabla}_0 \bb{v}^f \right) \right] \, d\Gamma^f_0
%	+ \int_{\Omega^f_0} J_\Gamma \bb{F}^{-T} \cdot \left( \bb{\nabla}_0 p \right) \, d\Omega^f_0
%\end{eqnarray}
\begin{align} \label{eqn:momentum_fluid_deformed}
\int_{\Omega^f_0} J^\Gamma \frac{\partial \bb{v}^f}{\partial t} \, d\Omega^f_0
	&+ \oint_{\Gamma^f_0}  \left[ J^\Gamma (\bb{F}^\Gamma)^{-\text{T}} \cdot \hat{\bb{n}}_0^f \right] \cdot \left(\bb{v}^f - \frac{\partial \bb{d}^\Gamma}{\partial t}\right) \bb{v}^f \, d\Gamma^f_0 = \notag \\
	&\oint_{\Gamma^f_0}  \left[ J^\Gamma (\bb{F}^\Gamma)^{-\text{T}} \cdot \hat{\bb{n}}_0^f \right]
	\cdot \left[\nu (\bb{F}^\Gamma)^{-T} \cdot \left( \bb{\nabla}_0 \bb{v}^f \right) \right] \, d\Gamma^f_0 \notag \\
	&\quad + \int_{\Omega^f_0} J^\Gamma (\bb{F}^\Gamma)^{-T} \cdot \left( \bb{\nabla}_0 p \right) \, d\Omega^f_0
\quad+\quad \int_{\Omega^f_0} \bb{f}_{b_0}^f \, d\Omega^f_0
\end{align}
where the time derivative in the first term is brought inside the integral as the initial volume is unchanging.
In addition, the identity
$\bb{\nabla} \cdot \left[ \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{v}^f \right)^T \right] = \bb{\nabla} \left( \bb{\nabla} \cdot \bb{v}^f \right) = \bb{0}$ has been employed, and the velocity $\bb{v}^\Gamma$ of the moving fluid domain has been replaced with the time derivative $\nicefrac{\partial \bb{d}^\Gamma}{\partial t}$ of the moving fluid domain displacement.

For the fluid domain, four boundary condition types are considered: inlet, outlet, no-slip wall, and symmetry.


%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Fluid-Solid Interface Conditions} \label{sec:fsi_interface}
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
At the interface $\Gamma_\text{fsi}$ between the solid and fluid regions, mass conservation leads to the \emph{kinematic} interface conditions, which state that the velocity of the fluid is equal to the velocity of the solid and the velocity of the moving fluid domain:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:kinematic}
	\bb{v}^f = \frac{\partial \bb{d}^s}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial \bb{d}^\Gamma}{\partial t}
	\quad\quad\quad\quad\text{on}\quad \Gamma_\text{fsi}
\end{eqnarray}
ensuring the fluid and solid share the same motion at the interface (i.e., there is no gap or overlap), assuming the fluid and solid interfaces are coincident in the initial configuration.

%Subscripts $f$ and $s$ are introduced to indicate fluid and solid quantities, respectively.

Linear momentum conservation yields the \emph{kinetic} interface condition in the deformed configuration $\Gamma_\text{fsi}$ as:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:kinetic_deformed}
	\hat{\bb{n}}^f \cdot \bb{\sigma}^f &=& -\hat{\bb{n}}^s \cdot \bb{\sigma}^s \\
	\hat{\bb{n}}^f \cdot \left[\nu \bb{\nabla} \bb{v}^f + \nu \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{v}^f \right)^T - p \right]
		&=& -\hat{\bb{n}}^s \cdot \bb{\sigma}^s
\end{eqnarray}
where $\hat{\bb{n}}^f = -\hat{\bb{n}}^s$, as the surface normals are assumed to point outwards from each region.
Equivalently, the kinetic condition can be expressed on the initial configuration as
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:kinetic_initial}

\subsection{Fluid Domain Motion} \label{sec:fluid_domain_motion}
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
The motion of the fluid-solid interface $\Gamma_\text{fsi}$ is dictated by the motion of the solid domain; however, as yet, we have not defined how this interface motion should be distributed throughout the fluid domain.
This fluid domain motion need not follow a conservation law and should instead be ideally defined to smoothly transit the interface motion, preserving the quality of the computational mesh—to be described below.
Nonetheless, any chosen fluid domain motion procedure or equation should follow the geometric (space) conservation law (Equation \ref{eqn:space_conservation}), 
which states that the rate of change of the fluid domain volume (or a subset of it) must equal the net flux of the domain velocity across its boundaries.
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:space_conservation}
%	\frac{d}{dt} \int_{\Omega^f} \, d\Omega^f
%	\; - \; \oint_{ \Gamma^f} \hat{\bb{n}}^f \cdot \boldsymbol{v}^\Gamma \, d\Gamma^\Gamma = 0
%\end{eqnarray}

In the current work, the displacement $\bb{d}^\Gamma$ of the fluid domain is assumed to follow the pseudo-solid linear elastic, static momentum equation:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:motion_momentum}
%    \oint_{\Gamma_0^f} \left( J^\Gamma (\bb{F}^\Gamma)^{-\text{T}} \cdot \bb{n}_0^f \right) \cdot \bb{\sigma}^\Gamma \ d\Gamma_0^f
    \oint_{\Gamma_0^f} \bb{n}_0^f \cdot
    \left[
    \mu^\Gamma \bb{\nabla}_0 \bb{d}^\Gamma + \mu^\Gamma \left(\bb{\nabla}_0 \bb{d}^\Gamma\right)^T
    + \lambda^\Gamma (\bb{\nabla}_0 \cdot \bb{d}^\Gamma) \textbf{I}
    \right]
    \, d\Gamma_0^f
    &=& \bb{0}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mu^\Gamma$ and $\lambda^\Gamma$ are spatially-varying \emph{stiffness} parameters for controlling the distribution of the motion.
Note that the quantities are not mapped to the deformed configuration, resulting in the equation being linear in $\bb{d}^\Gamma$; as a result, this approach does not formally conserve linear momentum, however, as will be shown in test cases section below, it is sufficient for maintaining the fluid domain computational mesh quality.
The value of $\bb{d}^\Gamma$ is prescribed on all boundaries of $\Gamma^f$, where the $\bb{d}^\Gamma = \bb{d}^s$ on the fluid-solid interface and zero on other boundaries.

\subsection{Spatio-temporal Discretisation}
\label{sec:space_time_discretisation}
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
The solution domain is discretised in both space and time.
The total simulation period is divided into a finite number of time increments, denoted as $\Delta t$, and the discretised governing equations are solved iteratively in a time-marching fashion.
The fluid and solid spatial domains are partitioned into a finite set $\mathcal{P}$ of contiguous convex polyhedral cells, where each cell is denoted by $P \in \mathcal{P}$.
The total number of cells in the mesh is indicated by $|\mathcal{P}| = |\mathcal{P}|^f + |\mathcal{P}^s|$, where $|\mathcal{P}^f|$ indicates the number of cells in the fluid mesh and $|\mathcal{P}^s|$ indicates the number in the solid mesh.
A representative cell $P$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cell}.
The set of all faces of cell $P$ is denoted by $\mathcal{F}_P$. This set is further subdivided into three disjoint subsets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Internal Faces} ($\mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P$): Faces that are shared with neighbouring cells, excluding the fluid-solid interface. 
    \item \textbf{Boundary Faces} ($\mathcal{F}^{\text{bnd}}_P$): Faces that lie on the boundary of the spatial domain, excluding the fluid-solid interface.
    %The boundary faces of cell $P$ are further classed into three disjoint sets, $\mathcal{F}^{\text{bnd}}_P \coloneqq \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P \cup \mathcal{F}^{\text{trac}}_P \cup \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P$, representing boundary faces where displacement ($\mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P$), traction ($\mathcal{F}^{\text{trac}}_P$) and symmetry ($\mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P$) conditions are prescribed.
    %\hl{include fluid}
       % \quad \text{with} \quad \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P \cap \mathcal{F}^{\text{trac}}_P = \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P \cap \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P = \mathcal{F}^{\text{trac}}_P \cap \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P = \emptyset.$
    \item \textbf{Fluid-Solid Interface Faces} ($\mathcal{F}^{\text{fsi}}_P$): Faces that lie on the fluid-solid interface; that is, faces that straddle a cell in the fluid mesh and a cell in the solid mesh.
\end{itemize}

\hl{I need to update below: notation becomes too verbose when FSI is added}
\hl{Maybe include as internal face and introduce notation for subsets}
Each internal face $f_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P$ corresponds to a neighbouring cell $N_{f_i} \in \mathcal{N}_P$, where $\mathcal{N}_P$ is the set of all neighbouring cells of $P$ in the same region. The outward unit normal vector associated with an internal face $f_i$ is denoted by $\mathbf{n}_{f_i}$, while $\mathbf{n}_{b_i}$ indicates the normal for a boundary face $b_i$, and $\mathbf{n}_{I_i}$ indicates the normal for a fluid-solid interface face $I_i$.
The vector $\mathbf{d}_{f_i}$ connects the centroid of cell $P$ with the centroid of the neighbouring cell $N_{f_i}$, whereas the vector $\mathbf{d}_{b_i}$ connects the centroid of cell $P$ with the centroid of boundary face ${b_i}$, and the vector $\mathbf{d}_{I_i}$ connects the centroid of cell $P$ with the centroid of the neighbouring cell $N_{I_i}$ across a fluid-solid interface.
%For convenience, we will also define the set of all faces of cell $P$ excluding those on a traction boundary as $\mathcal{F}_P^{\text{non-trac}} \coloneqq \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{int}} \cup \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{disp}} \cup \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{symm}}$.

\subsection{Newton-Type Solution Method}
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
To facilitate the application of a Newton-type solution algorithm, the governing equations are expressed in \emph{residual} form as:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:residual}
	    \bb{R}(\bb{U}) =
	         \begin{pmatrix}
			\bb{R}_u  \\
			R_p \\
			\bb{R}_m \\
		    	\bb{R}_d
		    \end{pmatrix}
		= \bb{0}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bb{R}$ represents the \emph{residual} (imbalance) of the equations, which is a function of the primary unknowns field $\bb{U} = \left\{\bb{v}, p, \bb{d}_m, \bb{d} \right\}$.
Concretely, the components of the residual are given as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \bb{R}_u %(\bb{U})
    &=&
%	\oint_{\tilde{\Gamma}}\left( J_m \bb{F}_m^{-\text{T}} \cdot \tilde{\bb{n}} \right) \cdot \left(\nu \bb{F}_m^{-\text{T}} \cdot \bb{\nabla} \bb{v} - p \right) \, d\tilde{\Gamma}
%	- \frac{d}{dt} \int_{\tilde{\Omega}} J_m \bb{v} \, d\tilde{\Omega}
%	- \oint_{\tilde{\Gamma}} \left( J_m \bb{F}_m^{-\text{T}} \cdot \tilde{\bb{n}} \right)\cdot (\bb{v} - \bb{v}_\Gamma) \boldsymbol{v} \, d\tilde{\Gamma}
%d\Gamma^f_0 \\
	\oint_{\Gamma^f_0}  \left[ J^\Gamma (\bb{F}^\Gamma)^{-\text{T}} \cdot \hat{\bb{n}}_0^f \right]
		\cdot \left[\nu (\bb{F}^\Gamma)^{-T} \cdot \left( \bb{\nabla}_0 \bb{v}^f \right) \right] \, d\Gamma^f_0
	+ \int_{\Omega^f_0} J^\Gamma (\bb{F}^\Gamma)^{-T} \cdot \left( \bb{\nabla}_0 p \right) \, d\Omega^f_0 \notag \\
	&&+ \int_{\Omega^f_0} \bb{f}_{b_0}^f \, d\Omega^f_0
	- \int_{\Omega^f_0} J^\Gamma \frac{\partial \bb{v}^f}{\partial t} \, d\Omega^f_0 
	- \oint_{\Gamma^f_0}  \left[ J^\Gamma (\bb{F}^\Gamma)^{-\text{T}} \cdot \hat{\bb{n}}_0^f \right] \cdot \left(\bb{v}^f - \frac{\partial \bb{d}_m}{\partial t}\right) \bb{v}^f
	\notag \\
    R_p %(\bb{U})
    &=&	\oint_{\Gamma^f_0}  \left[ J^\Gamma (\bb{F}^\Gamma)^{-\text{T}}  \cdot \hat{\bb{n}}_0^f \right] \cdot \bb{v}^f \, d\Gamma^f_0 \;+\; \mathcal{D}_p
    \notag \\
    \bb{R}_m %(\bb{U})
    &=&
    \oint_{\Gamma_0^f} \bb{n}_0^f \cdot
    \left[
    \mu^\Gamma \bb{\nabla}_0 \bb{d}_m + \mu^\Gamma \left(\bb{\nabla}_0 \bb{d}_m \right)^T
    + \lambda^\Gamma (\bb{\nabla}_0 \cdot \bb{d}_m) \textbf{I}
    \right]
    \, d\Gamma_0^f
    \;+\; \bb{\mathcal{D}}_m
%     \oint_{\Gamma_0} \bb{n}_u \cdot \left[ \mu_m \bb{\nabla}\bb{d}_m
%    + \beta_m \mu_m (\bb{\nabla}\bb{d}_m)^T
%    + \beta_m \lambda_m \text{tr}(\bb{\nabla} \bb{d}_m)\textbf{I} \right] 
%    \, d\Gamma_0
    \notag \\
    \bb{R}_d %(\bb{U})
    &=&
    \oint_{\Gamma_0^s} \left( J \bb{F}^{-\text{T}} \cdot \bb{n}_0^s \right) \cdot \bb{\sigma}^s \ d\Gamma_0^s
    + \int_{\Omega_0^s}  \bb{f}_{b_0}^s \, d\Omega_0^s
    - \int_{\Omega_0^s} \rho_0 \frac{\partial^2 \bb{d} }{\partial t^2} \; d\Omega_0^s
    \;+\; \bb{\mathcal{D}}_d
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathcal{D}_p$, $\bb{\mathcal{D}}_m$, and $\bb{\mathcal{D}}_d$ are stabilisation terms to be defined.

The residuals $\bb{R}_v$, $R_p$ and $\bb{R}_m$ are applied to each cell in the fluid domain and discretised, while residual $\bb{R}_d$ is applied to each cell in the solid domain and discretised, as is described below.
The resulting system of coupled nonlinear equations in terms of $\bb{U}$ can be linearised and iteratively solved using a Newton-type method:
%In Newton-type methods, a Taylor expansion about a current point $\bb{u}_k$ can be used to solve Equation \ref{eqn:residual} \cite{Knoll2004}:
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\bb{R}(\bb{u}_{k+1}) = \bb{R}(\bb{u}_{k}) \;+\;  \bb{R}'(\bb{u}_{k}) (\bb{u}_{k+1} - \bb{u}_{k}) \;+\; \text{H.O.T.} = \bb{0}
%\end{eqnarray}
%Neglecting the higher-order terms ($\text{H.O.T.}$) yields the strict Newton method in terms of an iteration over a sequence of linear systems: 
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:NewtonRaphson}
	\bb{J}(\bb{U}_k) \delta \bb{U} &=& -\bb{R}(\bb{U}_k), \notag \\
	\bb{U}_{k+1} &=& \bb{U}_k + s \, \delta \bb{U}, \notag \\
	\quad
	k &=& 0,1,...
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bb{J} \equiv \bb{R}' \equiv \partial \bb{R}/\partial \bb{U}$ is the Jacobian matrix.
Starting the Newton procedure requires the specification of $\bb{U}_0$.
%is iteratively solved by linearisation about the current value of the solution, leading to a linear system and iterative update of the solution vector:
%\begin{eqnarray}
%    \label{eq:NewtonRaphsonA}
%    \overbrace{\left[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{R}(\bb{u})}{\partial \bb{u}} \right]_n}^{\mathcal{J}} \Delta \bb{u} = -\mathcal{R}(\bb{u})_n \\
%    \label{eq:NewtonRaphsonB}
%    \bb{u}_{n+1} = \bb{u}_{n} + \alpha \Delta \bb{u}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where subscript $n$ indicates the outer (Newton) iteration index.
The scalar $s > 0$ can be chosen to improve convergence, for example, using a line search or under-relaxation/damping procedure, and is equal to unity in the classic Newton-Raphson approach.
Iterations are performed over this system until the residual $\bb{R}(\bb{U}_k)$ and solution correction $\delta \bb{U}$ are sufficiently small, with appropriate normalisation.

The linear system in Equation \ref{eq:NewtonRaphson} can be represented as
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{bmatrix}
\bb{J}_{vv} & \bb{J}_{vp} & \bb{J}_{vm} & \bb{J}_{vd} \\
\bb{J}_{pv} & \bb{J}_{pp} & \bb{J}_{pm} & \bb{J}_{pd} \\
0 & 0 & \bb{J}_{mm} & \bb{J}_{md} \\
\bb{J}_{dv} & \bb{J}_{dp} & 0 & \bb{J}_{dd}
\end{bmatrix}_k
\begin{bmatrix}
\delta \bb{v} \\
\delta p \\
\delta \bb{d}_m \\
\delta \bb{d}
\end{bmatrix}
=
-
\begin{bmatrix}
\bb{R}_v  \\
R_p \\
\bb{R}_m \\
\bb{R}_d
\end{bmatrix}_k
\end{eqnarray}
where the subscript $k$ indicates that the Jacobian matrix and right-hand side vector are evaluated in terms of $\bb{U}_k$.
The submatrices $\bb{J}_{ab}$ represent the coupling in the residual $a$ coming from the unknown $b$.
Several types of coupling exist between the residual components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Fluid-to-solid}, represented by $\bb{J}_{dv}$ and $\bb{J}_{dp}$:
	the fluid forces are passed to the solid by replacing the solid stress $\bb{\sigma}^s$ with the fluid stress $\bb{\sigma}^f$ at the fluid-solid interface in $\bb{R}_d$.
	\item \textbf{Solid-to-fluid}, represented by $\bb{J}_{vd}$ and $\bb{J}_{pd}$
	the solid motion is passed to the fluid equations by replacing the fluid velocity $\bb{v}^f$ by the solid velocity $\nicefrac{\partial \bb{d}^s}{\partial t}$ at the fluid-solid interface in $\bb{R}_v$ and $R_p$.
	\item \textbf{Solid-to-mesh}, represented by $\bb{J}_{md}$:
	the solid motion is passed to the fluid mesh by replacing the fluid mesh displacement $\bb{d}_m$ by the solid displacement $\bb{d}^s$ at the fluid-solid interface in $\bb{R}_m$. 
	\item \textbf{Mesh-to-fluid}, represented by $\bb{J}_{vm}$ and $\bb{J}_{pm}$:
	the fluid mesh motion velocity $\nicefrac{\partial \bb{d}_m}{\partial t}$ appears in the advection term of $\bb{R}_v$ and the fluid mesh motion displacement $\bb{d}_m$ appears in the fluid mesh deformation gradients terms ($\bb{F}_m$, $J_m$) of $\bb{R}_v$ and $R_p$.
\end{itemize}
Several submatrices are not present, indicating an absence of coupling:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\bb{J}_{mv}$, $\bb{J}_{mp}$: the fluid mesh motion $\bb{d}_m$ does not depend on the fluid velocity $\bb{v}$ and pressure $p$.
	\item $\bb{J}_{dm}$: the solid motion $\bb{d}$ does not depend on the fluid mesh motion $\bb{d}_m$. 
\end{itemize}


\hl{HERE}

For problems with $N$ scalar equations and $N$ scalar unknowns, the residual $\bb{R}$ and solution $\bb{u}$ vectors have dimensions of $N \times 1$. %, while the Jacobian matrix has dimensions of $N \times N$.
%In contrast, for vector problems, like the solid mechanics problems considered in this work, the residual and solution vectors have dimensions of $N_d N \times 1$ and the Jacobian matrix has dimensions of $N_d N \times N_d N$, where $N_d$ is the geometric dimension of the problem, e.g. $N_d = 2$ for 2-D and $N_d = 3$ for 3-D.
The components of the $N \times N$ Jacobian are
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:J}
	{J}_{ij} = \frac{\partial {R}_i (\bb{u})}{\partial u_j}
\end{eqnarray}

The current work focuses on vector problems, where the governing momentum equation is formulated in terms of the unknown displacement solution vector.
In this case, Equation \ref{eq:J} refers to the individual scalar components of the residual, solution, and Jacobian.
That is, for 3-D analyses, the residual takes the form
\begin{eqnarray}
	\bb{R}(\bb{u}) = \left\{ R_1^x, R_1^y, R_1^z, R_2^x, R_2^y, R_2^z, ..., R_n^z \right\}
\end{eqnarray}
and the solution takes the form
\begin{eqnarray}
	\bb{u} = \left\{ u_1^x, u_1^y, u_1^z, u_2^x, u_2^y, u_2^z, ..., u_n^z \right\}
\end{eqnarray}
In practice, it is often more practical and efficient to form and store the residual, solution and Jacobian in a \emph{blocked} manner, where the residual and solution can be considered as vectors of vectors.
Similarly, the Jacobian can be formed in terms of sub-matrix block coefficients.

In the strict Newton procedure, the residuals converge at a quadratic rate when the current solution is close to the true solution; that is, the iteration error decreases proportionally to the square of the error at the previous iteration.
Once the method gets sufficiently close to the true solution, the number of correct digits in the approximation roughly doubles with each iteration. 
However, quadratic convergence is only possible when using the exact Jacobian.
In contrast, a quasi-Newton method uses an approximation to the Jacobian, sacrificing strict quadratic convergence in an attempt to produce an overall more computationally efficient procedure.
From this perspective, the segregated solution algorithm commonly employed in finite volume solid mechanics can be viewed as a quasi-Newton method, where an approximate Jacobian replaces the exact Jacobian: 
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:Seg}
    \bb{\tilde{J}}(\bb{u}_k) \;\delta \bb{u} = -\bb{R}(\bb{u}_k)
\end{eqnarray}
In this case, the approximate Jacobian $\bb{\tilde{J}}$ comes from the compact stencil discretisation of a simple diffusion (Laplacian) term inertia terms.
A benefit of this approach is that the inter-component coupling is removed from the Jacobian, allowing the solution of three smaller scalar systems rather than one larger vector system in 3-D (or two smaller systems in 2-D).

A fully explicit procedure can also be viewed from this perspective by selecting a \emph{diagonal} approximate Jacobian $\bb{\tilde{D}}$ (only the inertia term), making the solution of the linear system trivial:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:exp}
    \bb{\tilde{D}}(\bb{u}_k) \;\delta \bb{u} = -\bb{R}(\bb{u}_k)
\end{eqnarray}


%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Fluid Mesh Motion}
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
An additional challenge is that the fluid mesh should be moved (smoothed) to distribute the FSI interface motion throughout the fluid domain.
To achieve this, the current work adopts a pseudo-solid approach where the fluid mesh is considered to be a solid domain, where the boundary displacements are prescribed.
The following governing equation is adopted for the fluid mesh motion:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:motion}
    \oint_{\tilde{\Gamma}}
    \bb{n}_u \cdot \left[ \mu_m \bb{\nabla}\bb{d}_m
    + \beta_m \mu_m (\bb{\nabla}\bb{d}_m)^T
    + \beta_m \lambda_m \text{tr}(\bb{\nabla} \bb{d}_m)\textbf{I} \right] 
    \, d\tilde{\Gamma}
    \;=\; \bb{0}
\end{eqnarray}
It should be noted that Equation \ref{eqn:motion} is integrated over the fluid reference configuration, but it is not mapped to the deformed configuration; this choice is made purely from an efficiency perspective: the purpose of this equation is merely to maintain fluid mesh quality, and it need not strictly correspond to a physical system.
To maintain fluid mesh quality near the FSI interface and boundary, the stiffness parameters $\mu_m$ and $\lambda_m$ are defined to be inversely proportional to the distance from the fluid boundary according to:
\hl{express with if-else}
\begin{eqnarray}
	\beta_m &=& \text{min}(\beta_\text{max} \bar{\delta}^{-1}, \text{max}(\beta_\text{min} \bar{\delta}^{-1}, \delta^{-1}))
\end{eqnarray}
where $\delta$ is the (approximate) distance from the fluid boundary.
In the current work, $\delta$ is calculated using a topological search approach, implemented in the \texttt{meshWave} class of OpenFOAM.
$\beta_m$ is then normalised with respect to its average value, i.e. $\beta_m \coloneqq \frac{\beta_m}{\bar{\beta_m}}$, such that $\bar{\beta_m} \equiv 1$. \hl{introduce additional terms to avoid confusion}


\subsection{Rest of CC discretisation}

In this work, a nominally second-order cell-centred finite volume discretisation is employed.

%The conservation equation (Equations \ref{eqn:momentum_lingeom}, \ref{eqn:momentum_TL}, or \ref{eqn:momentum_UL}) is applied to each cell $\mathcal{P}$ and discretised in terms of the displacement at the centroid of the cell $\bb{u}_P$ and the displacements at the centroids of the neighbouring cells $\bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} \in N_i$.
The conservation equation (Equations \ref{eqn:momentum_lingeom}, \ref{eqn:momentum_TL}, or \ref{eqn:momentum_UL}) is applied to each cell $P$ and discretised in terms of the displacement at the centroid of the cell $\boldsymbol{u}_P$ and the displacements $\boldsymbol{u}_{N_{f_i}}$ at the centroids of the neighbouring cells.
% $\boldsymbol{u}_{N_{f_i}} \in \mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{N}_P}$, where $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{N}_P}$ represents the set of such displacements.
Proceeding with the discretisation, the volume and surface integrals in the governing equation are approximated by algebraic equations as described below.


\subsubsection{Volume Integrals}
To discretise the volume integrals, the integrand $\bb{\phi}$ is assumed to locally vary according to a truncated Taylor series expansion about the centroid of cell $P$:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\bb{\phi}(\bb{x})  \approx \bb{\phi}_P + (\bb{x} - \bb{x}_P) \cdot \nabla \bb{\phi}_P
\end{eqnarray}
where subscript $P$ indicates a value at the centroid of the cell $P$.
%assuming a linear variation of the integrand across the cell, the mid-point rule approximates the integral in terms of the cell centre value.
Consequently, volume integrals over a cell $P$ can be approximated to second-order accuracy as
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:volume_integral}
	\int_{\Omega_P} \bb{\phi} \, d \Omega_P
		&\approx& \int_{\Omega_P}  \left[ \bb{\phi}_P + (\bb{x} - \bb{x}_P) \cdot \nabla \bb{\phi}_P \right] d \Omega_P \notag \\
%		&\approx& \int_{\mathrm{\Omega}}  \bb{\phi}_P d\mathrm{\Omega}  + \int_{\mathrm{\Omega}}  (\bb{x} - \bb{x}_P) \cdot \nabla \bb{\phi}_P d\mathrm{\Omega} \notag \\
		&\approx& \bb{\phi}_P \Omega_P
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Omega_P$ is the volume of cell $P$ and $\int_{\Omega_P} (\bb{x} - \bb{x}_P) d\Omega_P \equiv 0$ by definition of the cell centroid.
This approximation corresponds to the midpoint rule and one point quadrature.

Using Equation \ref{eq:volume_integral}, the inertia term (e.g. left-hand side term of Equation \ref{eqn:momentum_lingeom}) becomes
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:inertia}
	\int_{\Omega_P} \rho \frac{\partial \bb{u} }{\partial t}  d \Omega_P
%	\;&\approx&\;
%	\int_{\mathrm{\Omega}} \rho \left[ \frac{\partial \bb{u} }{\partial t}_P + (\bb{x} - \bb{x}_P) \cdot \nabla \frac{\partial \bb{u} }{\partial t}_P \right] d\mathrm{\Omega} \notag \\
	\;&\approx&\;
	\rho_P \left(\frac{\partial^2 \bb{u} }{\partial t^2}\right)_P  \Omega_P
\end{eqnarray}
Similarly, the body force term (e.g. the second term on the right-hand side of Equation \ref{eqn:momentum_lingeom}) becomes:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\int_{\Omega_P} \, \rho \, \bb{g} \,  d \Omega_P
	\;&\approx&\;
	\rho_P \, \bb{g}\,  \Omega_P
\end{eqnarray}
%where subscript $P$ indicates a quantity at the cell centre.
The discretisation of the acceleration in Equation \ref{eq:inertia} can be achieved using one of many finite difference schemes, e.g. first-order Euler, second-order backwards, or second-order Newmark-beta.
In the current work, the second-order backwards (BDF2) scheme is used:
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	 \left(\frac{\partial^2 \bb{u} }{\partial t^2}\right)_P
%	 &\approx& \frac{3\bb{v}_{t+1} - 4\bb{v}_{t} + \bb{v}_{t-1}}{2\Delta t} \notag \\
%	&\approx& \frac{3\left( \frac{3\bb{u}_{t+1} - 4\bb{u}_{t} + \bb{u}_{t-1}}{2\Delta t} \right) - 4\bb{v}_{t} + \bb{v}_{t-1}}{2\Delta t}
%\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:inertia2}
	\left(\frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{u}_P}{\partial t^2}\right)_P
	&\approx& \frac{3\boldsymbol{v}_P^{[t+1]} - 4\boldsymbol{v}_P^{[t]} + \boldsymbol{v}_P^{[t-1]}}{2\Delta t} \notag \\
	&\approx&
	\frac{3\left( 
		\dfrac{3\boldsymbol{u}_P^{[t+1]} - 4\boldsymbol{u}_P^{[t]} + \boldsymbol{u}_P^{[t-1]}}{2\Delta t} 
		\right) 
	- 4\boldsymbol{v}_P^{[t]} + \boldsymbol{v}_P^{[t-1]}}{2\Delta t}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta t$ is the time increment -- assumed constant here.
Superscript $[t]$ indicates the time level, with $\bb{u}_P^{[t+1]}$ corresponding to the unknown displacement at the current time step.
 The velocity vector $\bb{v} = \partial \bb{u}/\partial t$ at the current time step is also updated using the BDF2 scheme as
 \begin{eqnarray}
	\boldsymbol{v}_P^{[t+1]}	&\approx&
		\dfrac{3\boldsymbol{u}_P^{[t+1]} - 4\boldsymbol{u}_P^{[t]} + \boldsymbol{u}_P^{[t-1]}}{2\Delta t} 
\end{eqnarray}
Consequently, the displacement and velocity at the two previous time steps must be stored, or alternatively, the displacement at the previous four time steps.


\subsubsection{Surface Integrals}
The surface integral term can be discretised using one-point quadrature at each face $f_i$ as
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:surface_integral}
%	\oint_{\Gamma_P} \bb{\phi} \, d \Gamma_P
%		&=& \sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P} \int_{\Gamma_{f_i}} \bb{\phi} \,  d \Gamma_{f_i} \notag \\
%%		&\approx& \sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P} \int_{\Gamma_{f_i}}  \left[ \bb{\phi}_{f_i} + (\bb{x} - \bb{x}_{f_i}) \cdot \nabla \bb{\phi}_{f_i} \right] d \Gamma_{f_i} \notag \\
%%		&\approx& \int_{\mathrm{\Omega}}  \bb{\phi}_P d\mathrm{\Omega}  + \int_{\mathrm{\Omega}}  (\bb{x} - \bb{x}_P) \cdot \nabla \bb{\phi}_P d\mathrm{\Omega} \notag \\
%		&\approx& \sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P} \bb{\phi}_{f_i} |\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i} |
%\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:divStressDiscret}
	\oint_{\Gamma_P} \bb{n} \cdot \bb{\sigma}  \; d\Gamma_P
	&=& \sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P} \int_{\Gamma_{f_i}} \bb{n} \cdot \bb{\sigma}  \,  d \Gamma_{f_i} \notag \\
	&\approx&
%	\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{int}} \cup \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{disp}} \cup \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{symm}}} \bb{\Gamma}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{f_i}
%	\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{non-trac}}} \bb{\Gamma}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{f_i}
	\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{int}}} \bb{\Gamma}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{f_i}
	+ \sum_{d_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{disp}}} \bb{\Gamma}_{d_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{P}
	+ \sum_{s_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{symm}}} \bb{\Gamma}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{s_i}
	+ \sum_{t_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{trac}}} |\bb{\Gamma}_{t_i}| \bar{\bb{T}}_{t_i}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Gamma_P$ indicates the surface of cell $P$, $\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}$ indicates the area vector of face $f_i$, and vector $\bar{\bb{T}}_{t_i}$ represents the prescribed traction on the traction boundary face $t_i$.
%where $\Gamma_P$ indicates the surface of cell $P$, and $\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}$ indicates the area vector of face $f_i$.

It is noted that the displacement is assumed to vary linearly within each cell; hence, the displacement gradient and stress are constant within each cell.
In the current work, a unique definition of stress $\bb{\sigma}_{f_i}$ at each cell face $f_i$ is given as a weighted-averaged of values in the two cells ($\bb{\sigma}_P $, $\bb{\sigma}_{N_{f_i}}$) straddling the face \citep{Jasak1996}:
%The stress $\bb{\sigma}_{f_i}$ at an internal face is calculated by linear interpolation from the adjacent cell centres \citep{Jasak1996}:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:stressInterp}
	\bb{\sigma}_{f_i} &=& w_{f_i} \bb{\sigma}_P + (1 - w_{f_i}) \bb{\sigma}_{N_{f_i}}
\end{eqnarray}
%where $\bb{\sigma}_{f_i}$ is the stress at an interface face $f_i$, 
where the interpolation weight is defined as $w_{f_i} = (\bb{n}_{f_i} \cdot [\bb{x}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{x}_{f_i}])/(\bb{n}_{f_i} \cdot [\bb{x}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{x}_{P} ])$; however, achieving second-order accuracy of the displacement field is independent of the value of the weights, and, for example, $w_{f_i} = \nicefrac{1}{2}$ would also be sufficient.

The stress $\bb{\sigma}_{s_i}$ at a symmetry boundary face is calculated as
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:symm}
	\bb{\sigma}_{s_i}
		&=& \frac{1}{2} \left (\bb{\sigma}_P + \bb{R}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{P} \right) \notag \\
		&=& \left (\textbf{I} - \bb{n}_{s_i} \otimes \bb{n}_{s_i} \right) \cdot \bb{\sigma}_P
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bb{R}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{P}$ represents the mirror reflection of $\bb{\sigma}_P$ across the symmetry boundary face $s_i$.
The reflection tensor is $\bb{R}_{s_i} = \textbf{I} - 2 \bb{n}_{s_i} \otimes \bb{n}_{s_i}$ \citep{Demirdzic2022}, with $\bb{n}_{s_i}$ indicating the unit normal of the symmetry boundary face $s_i$.
From Equation \ref{eq:symm}, it is clear that shear stresses are zero on a symmetry plane boundary face.
Note from Equation \ref{eq:divStressDiscret} that the stress on displacement boundary faces is assumed to be equal to the stress $\bb{\sigma}_P$ at the centroid of cell $P$.

%The surface integrals are discretised in a similar fashion to the volume integrals, where the integrand $\bb{\phi}$ is assumed to vary locally according to a truncated Taylor series expansion about a face centroid $\bb{x}_{f_i}$:
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\bb{\phi}(\bb{x})  \approx \bb{\phi}_{f_i} + (\bb{x} - \bb{x}_{f_i}) \cdot \left(\nabla \bb{\phi} \right)_{f_i}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where subscript $f_i$ indicates a value at the centroid of the face $f_i$.
%Consequently, surface integrals about a cell $P$ can be approximated to second-order accuracy as
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:surface_integral}
%	\oint_{\Gamma_P} \bb{\phi} \, d \Gamma_P
%		&=& \sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P} \int_{\Gamma_{f_i}} \bb{\phi} \,  d \Gamma_{f_i} \notag \\
%		&\approx& \sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P} \int_{\Gamma_{f_i}}  \left[ \bb{\phi}_{f_i} + (\bb{x} - \bb{x}_{f_i}) \cdot \nabla \bb{\phi}_{f_i} \right] d \Gamma_{f_i} \notag \\
%%		&\approx& \int_{\mathrm{\Omega}}  \bb{\phi}_P d\mathrm{\Omega}  + \int_{\mathrm{\Omega}}  (\bb{x} - \bb{x}_P) \cdot \nabla \bb{\phi}_P d\mathrm{\Omega} \notag \\
%		&\approx& \sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P} \bb{\phi}_{f_i} |\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i} |
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\Gamma_P$ indicates the surface of cell $P$, and $\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}$ indicates the area vector of face $f_i$.
%$N_f$ represents the set of neighbouring cells which share a face with cell $P$, 

%Consequently, by assuming $\bb{\phi}$ represents $\bb{n} \cdot \bb{\sigma}$ in Equation \ref{eq:surface_integral}, the surface integral term (first term on the right-hand side of Equation \ref{eqn:momentum_lingeom}), corresponding to the divergence of stress, can be discretised as
%%by assuming that the stress varies linearly across the face, allowing the mid-point rule to be used:
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:divStressDiscret}
%	\oint_{\Gamma_P} \bb{n} \cdot \bb{\sigma}  \; d\Gamma_P
%	\approx 
%%	\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{int}} \cup \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{disp}} \cup \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{symm}}} \bb{\Gamma}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{f_i}
%%	\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{non-trac}}} \bb{\Gamma}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{f_i}
%	\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{int}}} \bb{\Gamma}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{f_i}
%	+ \sum_{d_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{disp}}} \bb{\Gamma}_{d_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{P}
%	+ \sum_{s_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{symm}}} \bb{\Gamma}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{s_i}
%	+ \sum_{t_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{trac}}} |\bb{\Gamma}_{t_i}| \bar{\bb{T}}_{t_i}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where vector $\bar{\bb{T}}_{t_i}$ represents the prescribed traction on the traction boundary face $t_i$.
%For faces $f_i$ in Equation \ref{eq:divStressDiscret} that are on traction boundary faces $b_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{trac}} \subset \mathcal{F}_P$, 
%the traction $\bar{\bb{t}}_{b_i}$ is known and is directly enforced; that is, $\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{f_i} = |\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}| \bb{n}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{f_i} =  |\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}| \bar{\bb{t}}_{b_i}$.
%subscript $f$ indicates a quantity at the centre of a cell face, and 
%The stress $\bb{\sigma}_{f_i}$ at an internal face is calculated by linear interpolation from the adjacent cell centres \citep{Jasak1996}:
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:stressInterp}
%	\bb{\sigma}_{f_i} &=& w_{f_i} \bb{\sigma}_P + (1 - w_{f_i}) \bb{\sigma}_{N_{f_i}}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where the interpolation ratio is defined as $w_{f_i} = (\bb{n}_{f_i} \cdot [\bb{x}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{x}_{f_i}])/(\bb{n}_{f_i} \cdot [\bb{x}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{x}_{P} ])$; however, using a value of $\nicefrac{1}{2}$ would also be sufficient to achieve second-order accuracy of the displacement field.
%For faces $f_i$ in Equation \ref{eq:divStressDiscret} that are on traction boundary faces $b_i \in \mathcal{F}_P^{\text{trac}} \subset \mathcal{F}_P$, the traction $\bar{\bb{t}}_{b_i}$ is known and is directly enforced; that is, $\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{f_i} = |\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}| \bb{n}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{f_i} =  |\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}| \bar{\bb{t}}_{b_i}$.
%Vector $\bb{d}_{f}$ connects cell centre $P$ with cell centre $N_f$, $\bb{d}_f = \bb{x}_{N_f} - \bb{x}_P$, and $\bb{n}_{f}$ is the outward-facing unit normal to the face $f$.
%Similarly, the stress $\bb{\sigma}_{s_i}$ at a symmetry boundary face is calculated as
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:symm}
%	\bb{\sigma}_{s_i}
%		&=& \frac{1}{2} \left (\bb{\sigma}_P + \bb{R}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{P} \right) \notag \\
%		&=& \left (\textbf{I} - \bb{n}_{s_i} \otimes \bb{n}_{s_i} \right) \cdot \bb{\sigma}_P
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\bb{R}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{\sigma}_{P}$ represents the mirror reflection of $\bb{\sigma}_P$ across the symmetry boundary face $s_i$.
%The reflection tensor is $\bb{R}_{s_i} = \textbf{I} - 2 \bb{n}_{s_i} \otimes \bb{n}_{s_i}$ \citep{Demirdzic2022}, with $\bb{n}_{s_i}$ indicating the unit normal of the symmetry boundary face $s_i$.
%From Equation \ref{eq:symm}, it is clear that shear stresses are zero on a symmetry plane boundary face.
%Note from Equation \ref{eq:divStressDiscret} that the stress on displacement boundary faces is assumed equal to the stress $\bb{\sigma}_P$ at the centroid of cell $P$.

The cell-centred stress $\bb{\sigma}_P$ is calculated as a function of the displacement gradient according to the chosen mechanical law, for example, as shown in Appendix \ref{app:mechLaws}.
The presented discretisation is second-order accurate in space for displacement if the cell-centred displacement gradients (and the stress) are at least first-order accurate in space, even if the cell faces are not flat.
To achieve this, the cell-centred displacement gradients are determined using a weighted first-neighbours least squares method \citep{Jasak1996},
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:leastSquaresGrad}
	\left(\bb{\nabla}\bb{u}\right)_P
%		&=&\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P} \omega_{f_i}^2 \bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}_{f_i} \left(\bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{u}_P \right) \notag \\
%		&&+ \sum_{b_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P} \omega_{b_i}^2 \bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}_{b_i} \left(\bb{u}_{b_i} - \bb{u}_P \right) \notag \\
%		&&+ \sum_{b_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P} \omega_{b_i}^2 \bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}_{b_i}^{\text{symm}} \left(\bb{R}_{b_i} \cdot \bb{u}_P - \bb{u}_P \right)
%		&=&\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P} \left( \nicefrac{1}{|\bb{d}_{f_i}|^2} \right) \bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}_{f_i} \left(\bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{u}_P \right) \notag \\
%		&&+ \sum_{b_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P} \left( \nicefrac{1}{|\bb{d}_{b_i}|^2} \right) \bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}_{b_i} \left(\bb{u}_{b_i} - \bb{u}_P \right) \notag \\
%		&&+ \sum_{b_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P} \left( \nicefrac{1}{|\bb{d}_{b_i}^{\text{symm}}|^2} \right) \bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}_{b_i}^{\text{symm}} \left(\bb{R}_{b_i} \cdot \bb{u}_P - \bb{u}_P \right) \\
%		&=&\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P} \frac{\bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}_{f_i}}{\bb{d}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{d}_{f_i}}  \otimes \left(\bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{u}_P \right) \notag \\
%		&&+ \sum_{d_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P} \frac{ \bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}_{d_i} }{\bb{d}_{d_i} \cdot \bb{d}_{d_i}} \otimes \left(\bb{u}_{d_i} - \bb{u}_P \right) \notag \\
%		&&+ \sum_{s_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P} \frac{\bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}_{s_i}}{\bb{d}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{d}_{s_i}} \otimes \left(\bb{R}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{u}_P - \bb{u}_P \right)
		&=&\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P} w_{f_i} |\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}| \frac{\bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}_{f_i}}{\bb{d}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{d}_{f_i}}  \otimes \left(\bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{u}_P \right) \notag \\
		&&+ \sum_{d_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P} w_{f_i} |\bb{\Gamma}_{d_i}| \frac{ \bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}_{d_i} }{\bb{d}_{d_i} \cdot \bb{d}_{d_i}} \otimes \left(\bb{u}_{d_i} - \bb{u}_P \right) \notag \\

\end{eqnarray}
which is exact for linear functions.
%where the least squares weights are $\omega_{f_i} = 1/|\bb{d}_{f_i}|$ and  $\omega_{b_i} = 1/|\bb{d}_{b_i}|$.
The vector $\bb{u}_{b_i}$ indicates the displacement at the centroid of boundary face ${b_i}$, while vector $\bb{d}_{d_i}$ connects the centroid of cell $P$ to the centroid of displacement boundary face $d_i$.
The quantity $\bb{R}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{u}_P$ represents the mirror reflection of $\bb{u}_P$ across the symmetry boundary face $s_i$.
% where the reflection tensor is $\bb{R}_{s_i} = \textbf{I} - 2 \bb{n}_{s_i} \otimes \bb{n}_{s_i}$ \citep{Demirdzic2022}.
The vector $\bb{d}_{s_i}$ connects the centroid $\bb{x}_P$ of cell $P$ with its mirror reflection $\bb{R}_{s_i}  \cdot \bb{x}_P$ through boundary face $s_i$.
Traction boundary faces are excluded in Equation \ref{eq:leastSquaresGrad}, as the displacement is unknown there; this is in contrast to the default approach in OpenFOAM \citep{Jasak2011}.
The $\bb{G}_P$ tensor for cell $P$ is calculated as
\begin{eqnarray}
	 \bb{G}_P &=&
%	 \sum_{{f_i} \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P} \omega_{f_i}^2 \bb{d}_{f_i} \bb{d}_{f_i}
%	 +  \sum_{{b_i} \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P} \omega_{b_i}^2 \bb{d}_{b_i} \bb{d}_{b_i}
%	 +  \sum_{{b_i} \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P} \omega_{b_i}^2 \bb{d}_{b_i}^{\text{symm}} \bb{d}_{b_i}^{\text{symm}}
%	 \sum_{{f_i} \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P} \frac{\bb{d}_{f_i} \otimes \bb{d}_{f_i}}{\bb{d}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{d}_{f_i}}
%	 +  \sum_{{d_i} \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P} \frac{\bb{d}_{d_i} \otimes \bb{d}_{d_i}}{\bb{d}_{d_i} \cdot \bb{d}_{d_i}}
%	 +  \sum_{{s_i} \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P} \frac{\bb{d}_{s_i} \otimes \bb{d}_{s_i}}{\bb{d}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{d}_{s_i}}
	 \sum_{{f_i} \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P} (1 - w_{f_i}) |\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}|  \frac{\bb{d}_{f_i} \otimes \bb{d}_{f_i}}{\bb{d}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{d}_{f_i}} \notag \\
	 &&+  \sum_{{d_i} \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P} (1 - w_{d_i}) |\bb{\Gamma}_{d_i}|  \frac{\bb{d}_{d_i} \otimes \bb{d}_{d_i}}{\bb{d}_{d_i} \cdot \bb{d}_{d_i}} \notag \\
	 && +  \sum_{{s_i} \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P} (1 - w_{s_i}) |\bb{\Gamma}_{s_i}|  \frac{\bb{d}_{s_i} \otimes \bb{d}_{s_i}}{\bb{d}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{d}_{s_i}}
\end{eqnarray}
As the $w |\bb{\Gamma}| \ \bb{G}^{-1}_P \cdot \bb{d}/(\bb{d}\cdot \bb{d})$ vectors in Equation \ref{eq:leastSquaresGrad} are purely a function of the mesh, they can be computed once (or each time the mesh moves) and stored.
Equation \ref{eq:leastSquaresGrad} approximates the cell-centre gradients to at least a first-order accuracy, increasing to second-order accuracy on certain smooth grids \citep{Syrakos2023};
first-order accurate gradients are sufficient to preserve second-order accuracy of the cell-centre displacements.

As noted, boundary conditions are enforced through the discretised surface integral terms at the boundary faces. % (Equations \ref{eq:divStressDiscret} and \ref{eq:RhieChow}).
If required, the displacement $\bb{u}_{t_i}$ on a traction boundary face $t_i$ can be calculated by extrapolation from the centre of cell $P$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
	\bb{u}_{t_i} = \bb{u}_P + \bb{d}_{t_i} \cdot \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_P
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bb{d}_{t_i}$ represents the vector from the centroid of cell $P$ to the centroid of the traction boundary face $t_i$.
Similarly, if required, the displacement $\bb{u}_{s_i}$ at a symmetry plane face $s_i$ is calculated using the same approach as Equation \ref{eq:symm}:
\begin{eqnarray} 
	\bb{u}_{s_i}
		&=&  \frac{1}{2} \left( \bb{u}_P + \bb{R}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{u}_P \right) \notag \\
		&=& \left (\textbf{I} - \bb{n}_{s_i} \otimes \bb{n}_{s_i} \right) \cdot \bb{u}_P
\end{eqnarray}




\subsubsection{Rhie-Chow Stabilisation}
%The discretisation is complete but, i
To quell zero-energy solution modes (i.e. checkerboarding oscillations), a Rhie-Chow-type stabilisation term \cite{Rhie1983} is added to the residual (Equation \ref{eqn:residual}).
% to quell such oscillations.
%The term introduces numerical diffusion to the discretisation, which reduces at a third-order rate.
% based on the earlier approach of Rhie and Chow \citet{demirdzic_numerical_1995}.
%One issue encountered with the finite volume method is that the discretisation of the governing conservation of momentum equation ( can be unstable and is known to suffer from checker-boarding errors .
%In order to rectify these issues, the Rhie-Chow stabilisation term \cite{rhie_numerical_1983} as introduced into solid mechanics by  is added to the discretised divergence of the stress in equation \ref{eqn:MomentumImplicitExplicit}.
%In the current approach, 
The Rhie-Chow stabilisation term  $\mathcal{D}_P^{\text {Rhie-Chow }}$ for a cell $P$ takes the following form:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:RhieChow}
	\mathcal{D}_P^{\text {Rhie-Chow}}
	&=& \sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P} \alpha \bar{K}_{f_i} \left[
		\left|\bb{\Delta}_{f_i} \right| \frac{ \bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_{f_i}\right|}	- \bb{\Delta}_{f_i} \cdot \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{f_i}
		\right]    \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}\right| \notag \\
	&&+ \sum_{d_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P} \alpha \bar{K}_{d_i} \left[
		\left|\bb{\Delta}_{d_i} \right| \frac{ \bar{\bb{u}}_{d_i} - \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_{d_i}\right|}	- \bb{\Delta}_{d_i} \cdot \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{P}
		\right]    \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{d_i}\right| \notag \\
	&&+ \sum_{s_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P} \alpha \bar{K}_{s_i} \left[
		\left|\bb{\Delta}_{s_i} \right| \frac{ \bb{R}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{u}_{P} - \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_{s_i}\right|} - \bb{\Delta}_{s_i} \cdot \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{s_i}
		\right]    \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{s_i}\right|
\end{eqnarray}
%which comes from the difference between Equations \ref{eq:diffusion} and \ref{eq:diffusion_exp}.
where $\alpha > 0$ is a user-defined parameter for globally scaling the amount of stabilisation.
Parameter $\bar{K}$ is a stiffness-type parameter that gives the stabilisation an appropriate scale and dimension.
Here, $\bar{K} = \frac{4}{3}\mu + \kappa = 2\mu + \lambda$ following previous work \cite{Jasak2000, Cardiff2017, Cardiff2018}, where $\mu$ is the shear modulus (first Lam\'{e} parameter), $\kappa$ is the bulk modulus, and $\lambda$ is the second Lam\'{e} parameter.
Vector $\bar{\bb{u}}_{d_i}$ represents the prescribed displacement at the centroid of displacement boundary face $d_i$.
%where $N_f$ represents the set of faces $f$ in cell $P$, and neighbouring cell centre $N_f$ shares face $f$ with the cell $P$.
%Vector $\bb{n}_{f}$ is the outward-facing unit normal to the face $f$.
The quantities $\bb{\Delta} = \nicefrac{\bb{d}}{\bb{d} \cdot \bb{n}}$ are termed the \emph{over-relaxed orthogonal} vectors \cite{Jasak1996}.
The displacement gradient $\left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{f_i}$ at the internal face $f_i$ is calculated by interpolation from adjacent cell centres (like in Equation \ref{eq:stressInterp}).
Similarly, the displacement gradient $\left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{s_i}$ at a symmetry boundary face $s_i$ is averaged from cell $P$ and its mirror reflection across face $s_i$, as in Equation \ref{eq:symm}.
Note that the displacement gradient at the displacement boundary $d_i$ is assumed to be equal to the displacement gradient at the centroid of cell $P$.
In addition, no stabilisation term is applied on a traction boundary face $t_i$.
%and increases in magnitude as the deviation between the $\bb{d}_{f}$ and $\bb{n}_{f}$ vectors increases, 
%In this way, the amount of stabilisation increases on distorted meshes.
%\hl{Should we mention Nishikawa alpha scheme?} \hl{Very similar: but scales differently with mesh distortion}
%and non-orthogonal correction vector $\bb{k}_f=\bb{n}_f-\bb{\Delta}_f$, where $\bb{n}_f$ is the outward-facing unit normal to the face $f$.
%Vector $\bb{d}_f$ connects the centre of cell $P$ with the centre of cell $N_f$ in the updated configuration.
%The first term on the right-hand side is treated implicitly, while the second term - representing non-orthogonal corrections at the face - is treated in a deferred correction manner.
%The Rhie-Chow stabilisation term, first used for finite volume solid mechanics by  \citet{Demirdzic1995}, consists of the numerical difference between a diffusion (Laplacian) term calculated using compact and larger computational stencils.

Within the square braces on the right-hand side of Equation \ref{eq:RhieChow}, the first terms represent a compact stencil (two-node) approximation of the face normal gradient, while the second terms represent a larger stencil approximation.
These two terms cancel out in the limit of mesh refinement (or if the solution varies linearly); otherwise, they produce a stabilisation effect that tends to smooth the solution fields.
The magnitude of the stabilisation is shown in Appendix \ref{app:RhieChow} to reduce at a second-order rate (not a third-order rate as stated previously \citep{Demirdzic1995}), and hence does not affect the overall scheme's second-order accuracy.
It is informative to note that the first term in the square bracket in Equation \ref{eq:RhieChow} can be expressed, assuming $(\bb{d}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{n}_{f_i}) > 0$, as
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:RhieChow2}
	\alpha \left[ \left|\bb{\Delta}_{f_i} \right| \frac{ \bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_{f_i}\right|}	-  \bb{\Delta}_{f_i} \cdot \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{f_i} \right]
	&=&
	\alpha \left| \frac{\bb{d}_{f_i}}{\bb{d}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{n}_{f_i}} \right| \frac{ \bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_{f_i}\right|}
	-  \alpha \frac{\bb{d}_{f_i}}{\bb{d}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{n}_{f_i}} \cdot \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{f_i} \notag \\
	&=&
	\frac{\alpha}{\bb{d}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{n}_{f_i}} \left[ \left( \bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{u}_P \right) -  \bb{d}_{f_i} \cdot \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{f_i} \right]
\end{eqnarray}
Noting that $\left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{f_i} = \left[ \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{N_{f_i}} + \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_P \right]/2$, Equation \ref{eq:RhieChow2} can be expressed as
\begin{eqnarray}
	\alpha \left[ \left|\bb{\Delta}_{f_i} \right| \frac{ \bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_{f_i}\right|}	-  \bb{\Delta}_{f_i} \cdot \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{f_i} \right]
	&=&
	\frac{\alpha}{\bb{d}_{f_i} \cdot \bb{n}_{f_i}} \left( \bb{u}_{N_{f_i}}^* - \bb{u}_P^* \right)
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
	\bb{u}_P^* &=& \bb{u}_P + (\bb{d}_{f_i}/2) \cdot \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_P  \\
	\bb{u}_{N_{f_i}}^* &=& \bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} - (\bb{d}_{f_i}/2) \cdot \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_{N_{f_i}}
\end{eqnarray}

So, this Rhie-Chow stabilisation can take the form of a \emph{jump} term; that is, it is a function of the jump in solution between neighbouring cells.
The two states, $\bb{u}_P^*$ and $\bb{u}_{N_{f_i}}^*$, are evaluated halfway between $P$ and $N_{f_i}$, and it may not be at a face centre; however, as noted by \citet{Nishikawa2010}, this will not affect the second-order accuracy of the method; consequently, the user is free to choose the value of $\alpha$ for stabilisation and accuracy purposes.
% but it doesn't matter because this team is only stabilisation and it vanishes in the grid refinement.
%As long as it vanishes for linear functions, second-order accuracy is preserved. It means that the parameter alpha can be chosen solely for the purpose of stabilization. 


%All dependent variables must be specified at the initial time.


%\subsubsection{Boundary Conditions}
%Boundary faces $f_i \in \mathcal{F}_{\text{bnd},P}$ are classified based on boundary conditions into displacement-type, traction-type, and symmetry-type faces.
%\hl{Comment on traction boundaries} \hl{extrapolate to get value or use constitutive law}
%Boundary conditions must be applied to the faces that coincide with the boundary of the solution domain.
%The discretised expressions on boundary faces are modified to account for either the known displacement components in Dirichlet conditions or the known traction for Neumann conditions.
%In the current approach, boundary face 

%Three types of boundary condition are considered here: prescribed displacement, prescribed traction, and symmetry planes.
%
%Two terms must be approximated on a boundary face $b$:
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:BCtermsLap}
%	\int_{\mathrm{\Gamma}_{b}} K_{imp} \bb{n}_{b} \cdot \left[ \nabla\left(\Delta\bb{u}\right) \right]_b d\mathrm{\Gamma}_{b}
%\end{eqnarray}
%which comes from Equation \ref{eq:diffusion}, and 
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:BCtermsStress}
%	\int_{\mathrm{\Gamma_b}}(j_b \bb{f}^{-\text{T}}_b \cdot \bb{n}_b) \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}_b \ d\mathrm{\Gamma_b}
%\end{eqnarray}
%which comes from Equation \ref{eq:surfaceStress}, where subscript $b$ indicates a quantity at a boundary face in the updated configuration.
%
%Equation \ref{eq:BCtermsLap} must be discretised both implicitly and explicitly (deferred correction), as per Equation \ref{eqn:MomentumImplicitExplicit}, while Equation \ref{eq:BCtermsStress} is discretised explicitly.
%The Rhie-Chow term is set to zero on boundary faces, and all geometric terms ($\bb{n}_{b}$, $\mathrm{\Gamma}_{b}$) are calculated on the updated configuration.

%Five classes of boundary conditions are employed in the current work (prescribed displacement, prescribed traction, symmetry plane, axisymmetric/wedge, frictional contact) as described below.
%An additional boundary condition where the normal component of the displacement is prescribed and the shear traction is zero is also used; the discretisation of this condition employs the prescribed displacement condition in the boundary normal direction and the traction condition in the tangential direction.
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Prescribed displacement,
%	\item Prescribed traction,
%	\item Symmetry,
%	\item Axisymmetric (wedge),
%	\item Frictional contact.
%\end{itemize}
%This enforcement of these five conditions is described below.

%\paragraph{Prescribed displacement}
%The displacement boundary condition, a Dirichlet condition, may be constant in time or time-varying and fixes the value of $\bb{u}$ at the centre of a boundary face.
%The corresponding displacement increment at the boundary face $\Delta \bb{u}_b = \bb{u}^{[m+1]}_b - \bb{u}^{m}_b$ is substituted into the calculation of the surface normal gradient term in Equation \ref{eq:BCtermsLap}.
%The resulting contribution of a boundary face $b$ to the discretised Laplacian term becomes:
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:diffusionBC}
%%	\underbrace{
%	\int_{\mathrm{\Gamma}_{b}}
%	 K_{imp} \bb{n}_{b} \cdot \left[ \nabla\left(\Delta\bb{u}\right) \right]_b d\mathrm{\Gamma}_{b}
%%	 }_{\text {implicit}}
%	&\approx&
%	K_{imp}^b \left|\boldsymbol{\Delta}_{b} \right|\left(\frac{\Delta \bb{u}_{b} - \Delta \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_b\right|}\right)\left|\bb{\Gamma}_{b}\right| \notag \\
%	    &&+ K_{imp}^b \; \bb{k}_{b} \cdot
%	    \left[
%	    \boldsymbol{\nabla} \left(\mathrm{\Delta}\bb{u}\right)
%	    \right]_P
%	    \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{b}\right|
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\bb{d}_b$ connects the cell centre $\bb{C}_P$ with the boundary face centre $\bb{C}_b$ in the updated configuration, and the non-orthogonal correction vector $\bb{k}_{b} = (\textbf{I} - \bb{n}_b \bb{n}_b) \cdot \bb{d}_b$.



%\paragraph{Prescribed traction}
%The traction boundary condition, constant in time or time-varying, is implemented by replacing $\bb{n}_f \cdot \bb{\sigma}_f$ on boundary faces with the known prescribed traction $\bb{t}_b$.
%Following calculation of the cell-centred displacements, displacements on traction boundary faces $\bb{u}_b$ is calculated by extrapolation from the adjacent cell centre:
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\bb{u}_b = \bb{u}_P + (\bb{x}_b - \bb{x}_P) \cdot \left(\bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \right)_P
%\end{eqnarray}
%where subscript $b$ indicates a value at the centre of a boundary face, and $P$ indicates a value at the centre of the adjacent cell.



%\paragraph{Symmetry plane}
%On a symmetry plane normal component of displacement is zero, and the tangential gradient of displacement is zero.
%For boundary faces on a symmetry plane, the mirror reflection $\left(\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}\right)_N$ of the cell-centre displacement increment $\left(\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}\right)_P$ can be obtained as
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\left(\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}\right)_N &=& \bb{R}_m \cdot \left(\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}\right)_P \notag \\
%		&=& \left(\textbf{I} - 2 \bb{n}_b \bb{n}_b \right) \cdot \left(\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}\right)_P
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\bb{R}_m$ is termed the reflection tensor.
%The discretisation in Equation \ref{eq:diffusion} takes the same form, but the neighbour cell-centre values are replaced by the mirror reflected values for boundary faces on the symmetry plane.
%The $\bb{d}_b$ vector at a symmetry plane boundary face is calculated as
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	 \bb{d}_b &=& \bb{R}_m \cdot \bb{C}_P - \bb{C}_P
%\end{eqnarray}
%%where $\bb{C}_P$ is the positional vector of the centre of cell $P$.
%This means that symmetry planes are orthogonal by definition, and the non-orthogonal correction (second term on the right-hand side of Equation \ref{eq:diffusion}) drops out.
%
%In the current work, the cell-centre values are corrected for skewness errors, resulting in the following contribution to the Laplacian term at a symmetry boundary face (Equation \ref{eq:diffusionBC}):
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\int_{\mathrm{\Gamma}_{u_b}}	 K_{imp} \bb{n}_{b} \cdot\nabla\left(\Delta\bb{u}\right) d\mathrm{\Gamma}_{b}
%	&=&
%	K_{imp}^b \left|\boldsymbol{\Delta}_{b} \right| \left( \frac{\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}_N^* - \Delta \bb{u}_P^*}{\left|\bb{d}_b\right|} \right) \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{b}\right|
%\end{eqnarray}
%where the skew-corrected cell-centre values are
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	 \bb{\Delta} \bb{u}_P^* &=&
%	 	\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}_P + \left[ (\textbf{I} - \bb{n}_b \bb{n}_b) \cdot \bb{d}_b \right] \cdot \left[ \bb{\nabla} \left(\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}\right) \right]_P \\
%	 \bb{\Delta} \bb{u}_N^* &=&
%	 	\bb{R}_m \cdot \left(\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}\right)_P^*
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%Displacement increment values on the symmetry planes are calculated as
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\left(\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}\right)_b = \frac{\left(\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}\right)_P^* + \left(\bb{\Delta} \bb{u}\right)_N^*}{2}
%\end{eqnarray}
%%where cell-centred values corrected for mesh skewness errors are

\subsection{Segregated Solution Algorithm} 
\label{sec:seg_alg}
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
The classic segregated solution algorithm can be viewed as a quasi-Newton method, where an approximate Jacobian is derived from the inertia term and a compact-stencil discretisation of a diffusion term (from the stabilisation term):
%The surface forces Laplacian term (first term on the right-hand side of Equation \ref{eqn:MomentumImplicitExplicit}) is discretised using central differencing with over-relaxed non-orthogonal correction \cite{demirdzic_finite_1993, jasak_application_2000, cardiff_development_2014, cardiff_large_2014, cardiff_lagrangian_2017}:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:diffusion}
	\tilde{\bb{J}} &=& \frac{\partial}{\partial \bb{u}} \left[ \oint_{\Gamma_P} \alpha \bar{K} \, \bb{n} \cdot \bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \; d\Gamma_P
	 \; -\;  \int_{\Omega_P} \rho \frac{\partial^2 \bb{u} }{\partial t^2} \, d\Omega_P \right]
\end{eqnarray}
The inertia term is discretised as described in Equations \ref{eq:inertia} and \ref{eq:inertia2}, while the diffusion term is discretised in the same manner as the compact-stencil component of the Rhie-Chow stabilisation term:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\oint_{\Gamma_P} \alpha \bar{K} \, \bb{n} \cdot \bb{\nabla} \bb{u} \; d\Gamma_P &\approx&
		\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P}  \alpha \bar{K}
		\left|\bb{\Delta}_{f_i} \right| \frac{ \bb{u}_{N_{f_i}} - \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_{f_i}\right|}    \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}\right| \notag \\
	&&+  \sum_{d_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P}  \alpha \bar{K}
%		\left|\bb{\Delta}_{d_i} \right| \left( \ \frac{ \bar{\bb{u}}_{d_i} - \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_{d_i}\right|}  \right) 
		\left|\bb{\Delta}_{d_i} \right| \frac{ \bar{\bb{u}}_{d_i}  - \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_{d_i}\right|} 
		\left|\bb{\Gamma}_{d_i}\right| \notag \\
	&&+ \sum_{s_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P}  \alpha \bar{K}
		\left|\bb{\Delta}_{s_i} \right| \frac{ \bb{R}_{s_i} \cdot \bb{u}_{P} - \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_{s_i}\right|}
		\left|\bb{\Gamma}_{s_i}\right|
\end{eqnarray}
When a diffusion term is typically discretised using the cell-centre finite volume method, non-orthogonal corrections are included in a deferred correction manner to preserve the order of accuracy on distorted grids.
However, in the current quasi-Newton method form, the approximate Jacobian's exact value does not affect the final converged solution, but only the convergence behaviour.
Consequently, non-orthogonal corrections are not included in the approximate Jacobian here. However, grid distortion is appropriately accounted for in the calculation of the residual.
Nonetheless, as a result, it is expected that the convergence behaviour of the segregated approach may degrade as mesh non-orthogonality increases.
%Similarly, the prescribed displacements from the $\mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P$ boundary faces does not affect the Jacobian.

The linearised system (Equation \ref{eq:Seg}) is formed for each cell in the domain, resulting in a system of algebraic equations:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:SegSys}
    \left[ \bb{\tilde{J}} \right]  \; \left[ \delta \bb{u} \right] = - \left[\bb{R}(\bb{u}_k)\right]
\end{eqnarray}
where $\left[ \bb{\tilde{J}} \right]$ is a symmetric, $M \times M$ stiffness matrix, where $M = 3|\mathcal{P}|$ in 3-D and $M = 2|\mathcal{P}|$ in 2-D.
If $\Delta t < \infty$ or $\mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P \neq \emptyset$, matrix $\left[ \bb{\tilde{J}} \right]$ is strongly diagonally dominant; otherwise, it is weakly diagonally dominant.
The block ($3\times3$ for 3-D, $2\times2$ for 2-D) diagonal coefficient for cell $P$ (row $P$, column $P$) can be expressed as
\begin{eqnarray}
	 \left[ \tilde{\bb{J}}\right]_{PP} &=&
		- \sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P}  \alpha \bar{K}
		\frac{ \left|\bb{\Delta}_{f_i} \right| }{\left|\bb{d}_{f_i}\right|}    \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}\right| \textbf{I} 
	    \quad-  \sum_{d_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P}  \alpha \bar{K}
%		\left|\bb{\Delta}_{d_i} \right| \left( \ \frac{ \bar{\bb{u}}_{d_i} - \bb{u}_P}{\left|\bb{d}_{d_i}\right|}  \right) 
		 \frac{ \left|\bb{\Delta}_{d_i} \right| }{\left|\bb{d}_{d_i}\right|} 
		\left|\bb{\Gamma}_{d_i}\right| \textbf{I} \notag \\
	 &&\quad - \sum_{s_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P} \alpha \bar{K}
		 \frac{ \left|\bb{\Delta}_{s_i} \right|}{\left|\bb{d}_{s_i}\right|}
		\left|\bb{\Gamma}_{s_i}\right|  \bb{n}_{s_i} \otimes \bb{n}_{s_i} 
	\quad - \quad \frac{9}{4}  \frac{\rho_P \Omega_P}{\Delta t^2} \textbf{I}
\end{eqnarray}
while the off-diagonal coefficients (row $P$, column $Q$) can be expressed as
\begin{eqnarray}
	\left[\tilde{\bb{J}}\right] _{PQ} &=&
		\alpha \bar{K} \frac{ \left|\bb{\Delta}_{f_{PQ}} \right| }{\left|\bb{d}_{f_{PQ}}\right|} \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{f_{PQ}}\right| \textbf{I} 
\end{eqnarray}
where subscript $PQ$ indicates a quantity associated with the internal face $f$ shared between cells $P$ and $Q$.
%where $N_f$ represents the set of faces $f$ in cell $P$, and neighbouring cell centre $N_f$ shares face $f$ with the cell $P$.
%The over-relaxed orthogonal vector $\bb{\Delta}_f = \frac{\bb{d}_f}{\bb{d}_f \cdot \bb{n}_f}$ 
%The non-orthogonal correction vector $\bb{k}_f=\bb{n}_f-\bb{\Delta}_f$.
% where $\bb{n}_f$ is the outward-facing unit normal to the face $f$.
%Vector $\bb{d}_f$ connects the centre of cell $P$ with the centre of cell $N_f$ in the updated configuration.
%The first term on the right-hand side is treated implicitly, while the second term - representing non-orthogonal corrections at the face - is treated in a deferred correction manner.

% since their implicit inclusion would require a coupled solution approach


%The block row in the Jacobian corresponding to cell $P$ can be expressed as
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:lin_sys_seg_cellP}
%	\tilde{\bb{J}}_P 	&=& \bb{A}_P \cdot  \bb{u}_P +  \sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P}  \bb{A}_{N_{f_i}} \cdot  \bb{u}_{N_{f_i}}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where the block diagonal coefficient is
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\bb{A}_P
%	&\approx& -\sum_{f_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{int}}_P}  \bar{K} \frac{ \left|\bb{\Delta}_{f_i} \right| }{\left|\bb{d}_{f_i}\right|} \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}\right| \textbf{I} \notag \\
%	&&-\sum_{d_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{disp}}_P}  \bar{K} \frac{  \left|\bb{\Delta}_{d_i} \right|}{\left|\bb{d}_{d_i}\right|} \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{d_i}\right| \textbf{I} \notag \\
%	&&- \sum_{s_i \in \mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P}  \bar{K} \frac{ \left|\bb{\Delta}_{s_i} \right|  }{\left|\bb{d}_{s_i}\right|} \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{s_i}\right| \bb{n}_{s_i} \otimes \bb{n}_{s_i}
%	\notag \\
%\end{eqnarray}
%and each off-diagonal coefficient is
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\bb{A}_{N_{f_i}} 	&\approx&  \bar{K} \frac{ \left|\bb{\Delta}_{f_i} \right| }{\left|\bb{d}_{f_i}\right|} \left|\bb{\Gamma}_{f_i}\right| \textbf{I}
%\end{eqnarray}


By design, matrix $\left[ \bb{\tilde{J}} \right]$  contains no inter-component coupling, i.e., each block coefficient is diagonal; consequently, three equivalent smaller linear systems can be formed in 3-D (or two linear systems in 2-D) and solved for the Cartesian components of the displacement correction, e.g.
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:SegSysX}
%     \bb{\tilde{J}}_x(\bb{u}_n)  \;  \Delta \bb{u}_x = - \mathcal{R}_x(\bb{u}_n) \label{eq:segX} \\
%     \bb{\tilde{J}}_y(\bb{u}_n)  \;  \Delta \bb{u}_y = - \mathcal{R}_y(\bb{u}_n) \label{eq:segY} \\
%     \bb{\tilde{J}}_z(\bb{u}_n)  \;  \Delta \bb{u}_z = - \mathcal{R}_z(\bb{u}_n) \label{eq:segZ}
     \left[ \bb{\tilde{J}}_x \right]  \;  \left[ \Delta \bb{u}_x \right] = - \left[ \mathcal{R}_x(\bb{u}_k) \right] \label{eq:segX} \\
     \left[ \bb{\tilde{J}}_y \right]  \;  \left[ \Delta \bb{u}_y \right] = - \left[ \mathcal{R}_y(\bb{u}_k) \right] \label{eq:segY} \\
     \left[ \bb{\tilde{J}}_z \right]  \;  \left[ \Delta \bb{u}_z \right] = - \left[ \mathcal{R}_z(\bb{u}_k) \right] \label{eq:segZ}
\end{eqnarray}
where $ \bullet_x$ represents the components in the $x$ direction, $ \bullet_y$ represents the components in the $y$ direction, and $ \bullet_z$ represents the components in the $z$ direction.
Matrices $\left[ \bb{\tilde{J}}_x \right]$, $ \left[ \bb{\tilde{J}}_y\right]$ and $\left[ \bb{\tilde{J}}_z\right]$ have the size $|\mathcal{P}| \times |\mathcal{P}|$.
An additional benefit from a memory and assembly perspective, is that matrices $\left[ \bb{\tilde{J}}_x \right]$, $ \left[ \bb{\tilde{J}}_y\right]$ and $\left[ \bb{\tilde{J}}_z\right]$ are identical, except for the effects from including boundary conditions ($\mathcal{F}^{\text{symm}}_P$ terms).
From an implementation perspective, this allows a single scalar matrix to be formed and stored, where the boundary condition contributions are inserted before solving a particular component.

The \emph{inner} linear sparse systems (Equations \ref{eq:segX}, \ref{eq:segY} and \ref{eq:segZ}) can be solved using any typical direct or iterative linear solver approach; however, an incomplete Cholesky pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method \cite{Jacobs1986} is often preferred as the diagonally dominant characteristic leads to good convergence characteristics.
Algebraic multigrid can also be used to accelerate convergence.
%In non-linear problems, this system of equations is solved multiple times with updated coefficients in a fixed-point iteration scheme. 
%As noted in previous articles on segregated methods, the inner system need not be solved to a tight tolerance as coefficients and source terms are approximated from the previous increment; a reduction in the residuals of one order of magnitude is typically sufficient. The outer iterations are performed until the predefined tolerance, typically $1 \times 10^{-6}$, has been achieved \cite{cardiff_lagrangian_2017}. 
%In the current updated Lagrangian approach, the mesh is moved to the deformed configuration at the end of each time step rather than after each outer iteration.
%Since the displacements are calculated at the cell centres, a linear least-squared method is employed here \cite{cardiff_lagrangian_2017} to interpolate the displacement increments to the mesh vertices, allowing the mesh to be moved.
%In this method, a linear least squares plane is fit through a vertex and its immediately adjacent cell centres. For boundary vertices, boundary face-centre values are also included in the fitting.
%
%The procedures have been implemented and publicly shared within the solids4foam toolbox \citep{Cardiff2018, Tukovic2018} of the open-source OpenFOAM software.

In literature, the segregated solution algorithm is typically formulated in terms of the total displacement vector (or its difference between time steps) as the primary unknown; in contrast, in the quasi-Newton interpretation presented here, the primary unknown is the correction to the displacement vector, which goes to zero at convergence.
In the total displacement approach, the matrix is the same, and the only difference is the formulation of the right-hand side, which is calculated as the difference between the residual and the matrix times the previous solution.
Equivalence of both approaches can be seen by adding $\left[ \bb{\tilde{J}} \right]  \; \left[ \bb{u} \right]_k$ to both sides of Equation \ref{eq:SegSys}:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:SegSys}
    \left[ \bb{\tilde{J}} \right]  \; \left[ \delta \bb{u} \right] + \left[ \bb{\tilde{J}} \right]  \; \left[ \bb{u} \right]_k  = - \left[\bb{R}(\bb{u}_k)\right] + \left[ \bb{\tilde{J}} \right]  \; \left[ \bb{u} \right]_k \notag \\
    \left[ \bb{\tilde{J}} \right]  \; \left[ \bb{u} \right]_{k+1} = \left[ \bb{\tilde{J}} \right]  \; \left[ \bb{u} \right]_k - \left[\bb{R}(\bb{u}_k)\right] \
\end{eqnarray}
where $\left[ \bb{u} \right]_k$ is the solution field at the previous iteration, and noting that $\left[ \bb{u} \right]_{k+1} = \left[ \bb{u} \right]_k + \left[ \delta \bb{u} \right]$.
In practice, the $\left[ \bb{\tilde{J}} \right]  \; \left[ \bb{u} \right]_k$ term on the right-hand side can be evaluated directly in terms of the discretised temporal and diffusion terms, without the need for matrix multiplication.
In the current work, the standard total displacement segregated formulation is employed.
%It is not expected that either formulation displays performance advantages.

As a final comment, the $\alpha$ scaling factor in the stabilisation term (Equation \ref{eq:RhieChow}) need not take the same value as in the approximate Jacobian (Equation \ref{eq:diffusion}).
In the current work, $\alpha$ is taken as unity in the approximate Jacobian, while the variation of its value in the residual calculation is examined in Section \ref{sec:RhieChowResults}.

\label{sec:JFNK_alg}
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%

%\hl{cite KnollKeyes2004}

As noted in the introduction, the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method avoids the need to explicitly construct the Jacobian matrix by approximating its action on a solution vector using the finite difference method, repeated here:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:JF}
	\bb{J} \bb{v} \approx \frac{\bb{R}(\bb{u} + \epsilon \bb{v}) - \bb{R}(\bb{u})}{\epsilon}

The derivation of this approximation can be shown for a $2 \times 2$ system as \cite{Knoll2004}:

%Choosing $\epsilon$ is important.
As noted above, choosing an appropriate value for $\epsilon$ is non-trivial, and care must be taken to balance truncation error (reduced by decreasing $\epsilon$) and round-off error (increased by decreasing $\epsilon$).


%\hl{2}
%- preconditioner => important
%- changes the JFNK approx.
%- precon affects the JF approx

%The literature indicates that the choice of preconditioner for the inner linearised system has a major impact on the efficiency and robustness of the overall solution procedure.
The purpose of preconditioning the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method is to reduce the number of inner linear solver iterations.
The current work uses the GMRES linear solver for the inner system.
%Left or right preconditioning, may be employed in a Jacobian-free context, and there are pros and cons to both.
Using right preconditioning, the finite difference approximation of Equation \ref{eq:JF} becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
%	(\bb{J} \bb{P}^{-1}) (\bb{P} \delta \bb{u}) = -\bb{R}(\bb{u})
	\bb{J} \bb{P}^{-1} \bb{v}
	\approx
	\frac{\bb{R}(\bb{u} + \epsilon \bb{P}^{-1} \bb{v}) - \bb{R}(\bb{u})}{\epsilon}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bb{P}$ is the preconditioning matrix or process.
In practice, only the action of $\bb{P}^{-1}$ on a vector is required, and $\bb{P}^{-1}$ need not be explicitly formed.
Concretely, the preconditioner needs to approximately solve the linear system $\bb{y} = \bb{P}^{-1} \bb{v}$.
%Thus, while we may refer to the matrix P, operationally the algorithm only requires the action of $P^{-1}$ on a vector.

%\hl{3}
%- we use approx J to form precon
%- many precon used in lit, we will consider ILU($k$) and MG, where MG is expected to be better, but also LU since direct solvers are popular in FE solid mechanics
In the current work, we propose to use the compact-stencil approximate Jacobian from the segregated algorithm $\tilde{\bb{J}}$ as the preconditioning matrix $\bb{P}$ for the preconditioned Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method.
%\hl{Comment on literature: used before but not yet for solids}.
This preconditioning approach can be considered a ``physics-based" preconditioner in the classifications of \citet{Knoll2004}.
The approach is conceptually similar to approximating a higher-order large-stencil scheme Jacobian by a compact-stencil lower-order scheme.
A benefit of the proposed approach is that existing segregated frameworks can re-use their existing matrix assembly and storage implementations.
Concretely, the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method requires only a procedure for forming this preconditioning matrix and a procedure for explicitly evaluating the residual.
Both routines are easily implemented - and are likely already available - in an existing segregated framework.
The only additional required procedure is an interface to an existing Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov implementation.
%"The motivation behind this approach is that there exist numerous, legacy algorithms to solve nonlinear systems, both IVPs and BVPs. These algorithms typically were developed with some insight into the time scales or physical behavior of the problem. As a benefit of this insight, a reduced implicit system, or a sequence of segregated explicit or implicit systems may be solved in place of the fully coupled system. "
In the current work, the PETSc package (version 3.22.2) \cite{PETSc} is used as the nonlinear solver, driven by a finite volume solver implemented in the solids4foam toolbox \citep{Cardiff2018, Tukovic2018} for OpenFOAM toolbox \citep{Weller1998} (version OpenFOAM-v2312).
The codes are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/solids4foam/solids4foam} on the \texttt{feature-petsc-snes} branch, and the cases and plotting scripts are available at \url{https://github.com/solids4foam/solid-benchmarks}.

Several preconditioners are available in the literature, incomplete Cholesky or ILU($k$) being popular; however, multigrid methods offer the greatest potential for large-scale problems.
As noted by \citet{Knoll2004}, algorithmic simplifications within a multigrid procedure, which may result in loss of convergence for multigrid as a solver, have a much weaker effect when multigrid is used as a preconditioner.
In this work, three preconditioners are considered:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ILU($k$): incomplete lower-upper decomposition with fill-in $k$. %The segregated solver uses ILU(0), that is, ILU with zero fill-in.
	\item Multigrid: the HYPRE Boomerang \citep{hypre} multigrid implementation.
	\item LU: the MUMPS \citep{MUMPS:1, MUMPS:2} lower-upper decomposition direct solver.
\end{enumerate}


%\hl{4 - globalisation}
A challenge with Newton-type methods, including Jacobian-free versions, is poor convergence when far from the true solution, and divergence is often a real possibility.
Globalisation refers to steering an initial solution towards the quadratic convergence range of the Newton method.
Several strategies are possible, and it is common to combine approaches \cite{Knoll2004}.
In the current work, a line search procedure is used to select the $s$ parameter in the solution update step (the second line in Equations \ref{eq:NewtonRaphson}).
Line search methods assume the Newton update direction is correct and aim to find a scalar $s > 0$ that decreases the residual $\bb{R}(\bb{u}_k + s \delta \bb{u}) < \bb{R}(\bb{u}_k)$.
%The scalar $s$ is typically $\leq 1$, but extrapolation ($>1$) is also possible for accelerating convergence, albeit at the expense of robustness.
In addition to a line search approach, a \emph{transient continuation} globalisation approach is used in the current work, where the displacement $\bb{u}_P$ for cell $P$ at time $t + \Delta t$ is predicted at the start of a new time (or loading) step, based on a truncated second-order Taylor series expansion:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:predictor}
%	\bb{u}^{[t+\Delta t]} = \bb{u}^{[t]} + \Delta t \left(\frac{\partial \bb{u}}{\partial t}\right)^{[t]} + \frac{1}{2} \Delta t^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 \bb{u}}{\partial t^2} \right)^{[t]}
	\bb{u}^{[t+\Delta t]}_P = \bb{u}^{[t]}_P + \Delta t \, \bb{v}^{[t]}_P + \frac{1}{2} \Delta t^2 \left( \frac{\partial \bb{v}}{\partial t} \right)^{[t]}_P
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bb{v}^{[t]}_P$ is the velocity of cell $P$ at time $t$, and $\left( \frac{\partial \bb{v}}{\partial t} \right)^{[t]}_P$ is the acceleration.
%$\left( \frac{\partial^2 \bb{u}}{\partial t^2} \right)_t$ 
In this way, for highly nonlinear problems, the user can decrease the time step size $\Delta t$ as a globalisation approach to improve the performance of the Newton method.
The predictor step in Equation \ref{eq:predictor} has been chosen to be consistent with the discretisation of the inertia term (Equation \ref{eq:inertia2}).


%\hl{5 - oversolving}
%Comment on over-solving => also applies to the segregated system.
%This could be a parameter we look at.
A final comment on the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov solution algorithm is the potential importance of \emph{oversolving}.
Here, oversolving refers to solving the linear system to a tolerance that is too tight during the early Newton iterations, essentially wasting time when the solution is far from the true solution.
In addition, some authors %\cite{See164_and_176_in_Knoll2004}
\cite{Knoll2004} have shown Newton convergence to be worse when the earlier iterations are solved to too tight a tolerance.
The concept of oversolving also applies to segregated solution procedures and has been well-known since the early work of Demird\v{z}i\'{c} and co-workers \cite{Demirdzic1995}, where the residuals are typically reduced by one order of magnitude in the inner linear system.
%The optimal choice of residual reduction for a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov finite volume solid mechanics procedure is explored in Section \ref{sec:test_cases}. \hl{Check: do we examine this?}
In the current work, the residual is reduced by a factor of 0.9 in the segregated approach and by three orders in the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov approach.
%\hl{Try for EW plastic: $-snes_ksp_ew -snes_ksp_ew_version 2 -snes_ksp_ew_rtol0 1e-4$}

%Knoll2004:
%The forcing term and the issue of ‘‘oversolving’’ a Newton step has recently gained interest [164,176]. The concept of ‘‘oversolving’’ implies that at early Newton iterations c is too small. Then one may obtain an accurate linear solution to an inaccurate Newton correction. This may result in a poor Newton update and degradation in the Newton convergence. In [164,176] it has been demonstrated that in some situations the Newton convergence may actually suffer if c is too small in early Newton iterations.


%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Checking Convergence}
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
The current work adopts three checks for determining whether convergence has been achieved within each time (or loading) step, closely following the default strategy in the PETSc toolbox:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Norm of the residual $|\bb{R}(\bb{u})|$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Absolute}: Convergence is declared when $|\bb{R}(\bb{u})|$ falls below an absolute tolerance $a_{\text{tol}}$, taken here as $1\times 10^{-50}$. This acts as a failsafe in situations where the \emph{relative} criterion (below) is ineffective because the initial solution already nearly satisfies the governing equation.
        \item \emph{Relative}: Convergence is declared when $|\bb{R}(\bb{u})|$ falls below $r_{\text{tol}} \times |\bb{R}(\bb{u}_0)|$, with $|\bb{R}(\bb{u}_0)|$ denoting the residual norm at the start of the time (or loading) step. In this work, $r_{\text{tol}} = 10^{-6}$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Norm of the solution correction $|\delta \bb{u}|$: Convergence is declared when the norm of the change in the solution between successive iterations is less than $s_{\text{tol}} \times |\bb{u}|$.
\end{itemize}

Although applying the same tolerances for the segregated and Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov solution procedures may seem reasonable, care must be taken with $s_{\text{tol}}$. The Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method typically makes a small number of large corrections to the solution, whereas the segregated procedure often makes a large number of small corrections. Consequently, if the same $s_{\text{tol}}$ value were used, the segregated procedure might be declared convergent prematurely. To avoid this, $s_{\text{tol}}$ is set to zero in the present work, meaning convergence is based solely on residual reduction. Nonetheless, setting $s_{\text{tol}} > 0$ could yield a more robust procedure capable of handling potential stalling.
